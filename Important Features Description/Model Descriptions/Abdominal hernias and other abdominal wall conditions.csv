In astrocytes, the calcium released into the cytosol allows the Ca(2+)-dependent release of L-glutamate into the synaptic cleft through BEST1, that targets the neuronal postsynaptic GRIN2A/NMDAR receptor resulting in the synaptic plasticity regulation (By similarity). May play a role in platelets activation and in vascular development (PubMed:10079109).

Has broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze a considerable variety of compounds: however, only a few substrates, such as diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate; PPi), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and N-phosphocreatine are natural substrates (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:2220817). Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration (PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Also promotes dephosphorylation of osteopontin (SSP1), an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization in its phosphorylated state; it is however unclear whether ALPL/TNAP mediates SSP1 dephosphorylation via a direct or indirect manner (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PLP to pyridoxal (PL), the transportable form of vitamin B6, in order to provide a sufficient amount of PLP in the brain, an essential cofactor for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of diverse neurotransmitters (PubMed:20049532, PubMed:2220817). Additionally, also able to mediate ATP degradation in a stepwise manner to adenosine, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for purinergic receptors (By similarity). Also capable of dephosphorylating microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as other phosphorylated small-molecules, such as poly-inosine:cytosine (poly I:C) (PubMed:28448526). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating hydrolysis of N-phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P09242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12162492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20049532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2220817, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23688511, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25982064, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28448526}.","ACT_SITE 110; /note=""Phosphoserine intermediate""; /evidence=""ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05187, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10042""",,ADP phosphatase activity [GO:0043262]; alkaline phosphatase activity [GO:0004035]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATP-dependent H2AZ histone chaperone activity [GO:0140849]; ATP-dependent H3-H4 histone complex chaperone activity [GO:0140665]; calcium ion binding [GO:0005509]; chromatin extrusion motor activity [GO:0140584]; cohesin loader activity [GO:0061775]; DNA clamp loader activity [GO:0003689]; inorganic diphosphate phosphatase activity [GO:0004427]; phosphoamidase activity [GO:0050187]; phosphoethanolamine phosphatase activity [GO:0052732]; pyridoxal phosphatase activity [GO:0033883]; pyrophosphatase activity [GO:0016462],"DISEASE: Hypophosphatasia (HOPS) [MIM:146300]: A metabolic bone disease characterized by defective skeletal mineralization and biochemically by deficient activity of the tissue non-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase.

Mainly converts arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate) to the specific bioactive lipid (12S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoate/(12S)-HPETE (PubMed:17493578, PubMed:22984144, PubMed:24282679, PubMed:8319693, PubMed:8500694). Through the production of bioactive lipids like (12S)-HPETE it regulates different biological processes including platelet activation (PubMed:8319693, PubMed:8500694). It can also catalyze the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as (14S)-hydroperoxy-docosahexaenoate/(14S)-HPDHA resulting in the formation of (13S,14S)-epoxy-DHA (PubMed:23504711). Furthermore, it may participate in the sequential oxidations of DHA ((4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate) to generate specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like resolvin D5 ((7S,17S)-diHPDHA) and (7S,14S)-diHPDHA, that actively down-regulate the immune response and have anti-aggregation properties with platelets (PubMed:32404334). An additional function involves a multistep process by which it transforms leukotriene A4/LTA4 into the bioactive lipids lipoxin A4/LXA4 and lipoxin B4/LXB4, both are vasoactive and LXA4 may regulate neutrophil function via occupancy of specific recognition sites (PubMed:8250832). Can also peroxidize linoleate ((9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate) to (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate/ (13S-HPODE) (By similarity). Due to its role in regulating both the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, an angiogenic factor involved in the survival and metastasis of solid tumors) and the expression of integrin beta-1 (known to affect tumor cell migration and proliferation), it can be regarded as protumorigenic (PubMed:16638750, PubMed:22237009, PubMed:9751607).

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated.

Mediates the major part of the dendritic A-type current I(SA) in brain neurons (By similarity). This current is activated at membrane potentials that are below the threshold for action potentials. It regulates neuronal excitability, prolongs the latency before the first spike in a series of action potentials, regulates the frequency of repetitive action potential firing, shortens the duration of action potentials and regulates the back-propagation of action potentials from the neuronal cell body to the dendrites. Contributes to the regulation of the circadian rhythm of action potential firing in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons, which regulates the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity (By similarity). Functions downstream of the metabotropic glutamate receptor GRM5 and plays a role in neuronal excitability and in nociception mediated by activation of GRM5 (By similarity). Mediates the transient outward current I(to) in rodent heart left ventricle apex cells, but not in human heart, where this current is mediated by another family member. Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient (PubMed:10551270, PubMed:11507158, PubMed:14623880, PubMed:14695263, PubMed:14980201, PubMed:15454437, PubMed:16934482, PubMed:19171772, PubMed:24501278, PubMed:24811166, PubMed:34552243, PubMed:35597238). The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:11507158). Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCND2 and KCND3; channel properties depend on the type of pore-forming alpha subunits that are part of the channel. In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes. Interaction with specific isoforms of the regulatory subunits KCNIP1, KCNIP2, KCNIP3 or KCNIP4 strongly increases expression at the cell surface and thereby increases channel activity; it modulates the kinetics of channel activation and inactivation, shifts the threshold for channel activation to more negative voltage values, shifts the threshold for inactivation to less negative voltages and accelerates recovery after inactivation (PubMed:14623880, PubMed:14980201, PubMed:15454437, PubMed:19171772, PubMed:24501278, PubMed:24811166). Likewise, interaction with DPP6 or DPP10 promotes expression at the cell membrane and regulates both channel characteristics and activity (By similarity).
