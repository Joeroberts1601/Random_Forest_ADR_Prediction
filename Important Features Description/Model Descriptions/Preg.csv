Within the complex it catalyzes the attachment of both L-glutamate and L-proline to their cognate tRNAs in a two-step reaction where the amino acid is first activated by ATP to form a covalent intermediate with AMP. Subsequently, the activated amino acid is transferred to the acceptor end of the cognate tRNA to form L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) and L-prolyl-tRNA(Pro) (PubMed:23263184, PubMed:24100331, PubMed:29576217, PubMed:3290852, PubMed:37212275). Upon interferon-gamma stimulation, EPRS1 undergoes phosphorylation, causing its dissociation from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex. It is recruited to form the GAIT complex, which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements found in the 3'-UTR of various inflammatory mRNAs, such as ceruloplasmin. The GAIT complex inhibits the translation of these mRNAs, allowing interferon-gamma to redirect the function of EPRS1 from protein synthesis to translation inhibition in specific cell contexts (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094). Furthermore, it can function as a downstream effector in the mTORC1 signaling pathway, by promoting the translocation of SLC27A1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty acid by adipocytes. Thereby, EPRS1 also plays a role in fat metabolism and more indirectly influences lifespan (PubMed:28178239). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15479637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23071094, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23263184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24100331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28178239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29576217, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3290852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37212275}.",,,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; glutamate-tRNA ligase activity [GO:0004818]; GTPase binding [GO:0051020]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; proline-tRNA ligase activity [GO:0004827]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; RNA stem-loop binding [GO:0035613]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270],"DISEASE: Leukodystrophy, hypomyelinating, 15 (HLD15) [MIM:617951]: An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with thinning of the corpus callosum.

In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating several substrates, such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2) and EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1) (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12747827, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:26588989, PubMed:37541260).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. Binds via DLX1 to enhancers located in the intergenic region between DLX5 and DLX6 and this binding is stabilized by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Evf2 (By similarity).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner (PubMed:29374058, PubMed:8804307). Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Has a strong influence on vitamin D-mediated transcriptional activity from an enhancer vitamin D receptor element (VDRE). May be a link between mammalian SWI-SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimer (PubMed:14698202).

SRY,Q14974,Importin subunit beta-1 (Importin-90) (Karyopherin subunit beta-1) (Nuclear factor p97) (Pore targeting complex 97 kDa subunit) (PTAC97),NTF97,"FUNCTION: Functions in nuclear protein import, either in association with an adapter protein, like an importin-alpha subunit, which binds to nuclear localization signals (NLS) in cargo substrates, or by acting as autonomous nuclear transport receptor (PubMed:10228156, PubMed:11682607, PubMed:11891849, PubMed:19386897, PubMed:20818336, PubMed:24699649, PubMed:7615630, PubMed:9687515). Acting autonomously, serves itself as NLS receptor (PubMed:10228156, PubMed:11682607, PubMed:11891849, PubMed:19386897, PubMed:20818336, PubMed:24699649, PubMed:7615630, PubMed:9687515). Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism (PubMed:10228156, PubMed:11682607, PubMed:11891849, PubMed:19386897, PubMed:20818336, PubMed:24699649, PubMed:7615630, PubMed:9687515). At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin (PubMed:10228156, PubMed:11682607, PubMed:11891849, PubMed:19386897, PubMed:20818336, PubMed:24699649, PubMed:7615630, PubMed:9687515). The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus (PubMed:10228156, PubMed:11682607, PubMed:11891849, PubMed:19386897, PubMed:24699649, PubMed:7615630, PubMed:9687515). Mediates autonomously the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins RPL23A, RPS7 and RPL5 (PubMed:11682607, PubMed:9687515). In association with IPO7, mediates the nuclear import of H1 histone (PubMed:10228156). In vitro, mediates nuclear import of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones (By similarity).

Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events (PubMed:23911289). Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes, such as N-Cor repressor complex, which activate the histone deacetylase activity (PubMed:23911289, PubMed:22230954). Participates in the BCL6 transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300 acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal gene expression (PubMed:23911289). Acts as a molecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PML bodies for sumoylation (By similarity). Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation of NFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in a PI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading to endothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidative stress (PubMed:25190803). Regulates both the transcriptional activation and repression phases of the circadian clock in a deacetylase activity-independent manner (By similarity). During the activation phase, promotes the accumulation of ubiquitinated BMAL1 at the E-boxes and during the repression phase, blocks FBXL3-mediated CRY1/2 ubiquitination and promotes the interaction of CRY1 and BMAL1 (By similarity). The NCOR1-HDAC3 complex regulates the circadian expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 and the genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver (By similarity). Also functions as a deacetylase for non-histone targets, such as KAT5, MEF2D, MAPK14, RARA and STAT3 (PubMed:15653507, PubMed:21030595, PubMed:21444723, PubMed:25301942, PubMed:28167758). Serves as a corepressor of RARA, mediating its deacetylation and repression, leading to inhibition of RARE DNA element binding (PubMed:28167758). In association with RARA, plays a role in the repression of microRNA-10a and thereby in the inflammatory response (PubMed:28167758). In addition to protein deacetylase activity, also acts as a protein-lysine deacylase by recognizing other acyl groups: catalyzes removal of (2E)-butenoyl (crotonyl), lactoyl (lactyl) and 2-hydroxyisobutanoyl (2-hydroxyisobutyryl) acyl groups from lysine residues, leading to protein decrotonylation, delactylation and de-2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, respectively (PubMed:28497810, PubMed:29192674, PubMed:34608293, PubMed:35044827). Catalyzes decrotonylation of MAPRE1/EB1 (PubMed:34608293). Mediates delactylation NBN/NBS1, thereby inhibiting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:38961290). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O88895, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15653507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21444723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22230954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25190803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25301942, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28167758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28497810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29192674, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32404892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34608293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35044827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38961290}.","ACT_SITE 135; /evidence=""ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q13547""",,"chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; chromatin DNA binding [GO:0031490]; cyclin binding [GO:0030332]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; histone deacetylase activity [GO:0004407]; histone deacetylase binding [GO:0042826]; histone decrotonylase activity [GO:0160009]; histone H3K14 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0031078]; histone H3K4 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:1990162]; histone H3K9 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0032129]; histone H4K12 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0140937]; histone H4K16 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0034739]; histone H4K5 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0180032]; histone H4K8 deacetylase activity, hydrolytic mechanism [GO:0180033]; NF-kappaB binding [GO:0051059]; protein de-2-hydroxyisobutyrylase activity [GO:0160010]; protein decrotonylase activity [GO:0160008]; protein lysine deacetylase activity [GO:0033558]; protein lysine delactylase activity [GO:0160216]; transcription corepressor activity [GO:0003714]; transcription corepressor binding [GO:0001222]; tubulin deacetylase activity [GO:0042903]",,CHEMBL1829;

Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 confers serine specificity by completing the PARP1 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33186521, PubMed:33589610, PubMed:34625544, PubMed:34874266). Also catalyzes tyrosine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins following interaction with HPF1 (PubMed:29954836, PubMed:30257210). Following interaction with NMNAT1, catalyzes glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; NMNAT1 confers glutamate and aspartate specificity (By similarity). PARP1 initiates the repair of DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones (H2BS6ADPr and H3S10ADPr), thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:17177976, PubMed:18172500, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:19661379, PubMed:23230272, PubMed:27067600, PubMed:34465625, PubMed:34874266). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP1 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:33683197, PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). In addition to base excision repair (BER) pathway, also involved in double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair: together with TIMELESS, accumulates at DNA damage sites and promotes homologous recombination repair by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:26344098, PubMed:30356214). Mediates the poly-ADP-ribosylation of a number of proteins, including itself, APLF, CHFR, RPA1 and NFAT5 (PubMed:17396150, PubMed:19764761, PubMed:24906880, PubMed:34049076). In addition to proteins, also able to ADP-ribosylate DNA: catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of DNA strand break termini containing terminal phosphates and a 2'-OH group in single- and double-stranded DNA, respectively (PubMed:27471034). Required for PARP9 and DTX3L recruitment to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-mediated DNA repair in neurons plays a role in sleep: senses DNA damage in neurons and promotes sleep, facilitating efficient DNA repair (By similarity). In addition to DNA repair, also involved in other processes, such as transcription regulation, programmed cell death, membrane repair, adipogenesis and innate immunity (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:17177976, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:27256882, PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35124853, PubMed:35393539, PubMed:35460603). Acts as a repressor of transcription: binds to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure in a manner similar to histone H1, thereby altering RNA polymerase II (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:22464733). Acts both as a positive and negative regulator of transcription elongation, depending on the context (PubMed:27256882, PubMed:35393539). Acts as a positive regulator of transcription elongation by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of NELFE, preventing RNA-binding activity of NELFE and relieving transcription pausing (PubMed:27256882). Acts as a negative regulator of transcription elongation in response to DNA damage by catalyzing poly-ADP-ribosylation of CCNT1, disrupting the phase separation activity of CCNT1 and subsequent activation of CDK9 (PubMed:35393539). Involved in replication fork progression following interaction with CARM1: mediates poly-ADP-ribosylation at replication forks, slowing fork progression (PubMed:33412112). Poly-ADP-ribose chains generated by PARP1 also play a role in poly-ADP-ribose-dependent cell death, a process named parthanatos (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35460603). Acts by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of CGAS: PARP1 translocates into the cytosol following phosphorylation by PRKDC and catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of CGAS (PubMed:35460603). Acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis: catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B on 'Glu-35' (H2BE35ADPr) following interaction with NMNAT1, inhibiting phosphorylation of H2B at 'Ser-36' (H2BS36ph), thereby blocking expression of pro-adipogenetic genes (By similarity). Involved in the synthesis of ATP in the nucleus, together with NMNAT1, PARG and NUDT5 (PubMed:27257257). Nuclear ATP generation is required for extensive chromatin remodeling events that are energy-consuming (PubMed:27257257). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P11103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15607977, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17177976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17396150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18055453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18172500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19344625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19661379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19764761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20388712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21680843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22464733, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22582261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25043379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26344098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26626479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26626480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27067600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27256882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27257257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27471034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28190768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29954836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30104678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30257210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30356214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31796734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32028527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32241924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32315358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32358582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32844745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33186521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33412112, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33589610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33683197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34049076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34465625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34625544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34732825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34737271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34795260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34874266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35124853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35393539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35460603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7852410, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9315851}.; FUNCTION: [Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1, processed C-terminus]: Promotes AIFM1-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:33168626).

These variations include two duplications of approximately 123 kb and 85 kb, the former of which spans the entire SOX3 gene; a 343 kb deletion immediately upstream of SOX3 that is probably responsible of altered regulation (and not increased dosage) of SOX3; a large (approximately 6 Mb) duplication that encompasses SOX3 and at least 18 additional distally located genes. Its proximal breakpoint falls within the SOX3 regulatory region. This large rearrangement has been found in a patient with XX male reversal and a complex phenotype that also includes a scrotal hypoplasia, microcephaly, developmental delay, and growth retardation.; DISEASE: Hypoparathyroidism, X-linked (HYPX) [MIM:307700]: An X-linked form of true hypoparathyroidism characterized by neonatal or infantile onset and absence of parathyroid glands.

In T-cells, functions primarily as a coreceptor for MHC class II molecule:peptide complex. The antigens presented by class II peptides are derived from extracellular proteins while class I peptides are derived from cytosolic proteins. Interacts simultaneously with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the MHC class II presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). In turn, recruits the Src kinase LCK to the vicinity of the TCR-CD3 complex. LCK then initiates different intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating various substrates ultimately leading to lymphokine production, motility, adhesion and activation of T-helper cells. In other cells such as macrophages or NK cells, plays a role in differentiation/activation, cytokine expression and cell migration in a TCR/LCK-independent pathway. Participates in the development of T-helper cells in the thymus and triggers the differentiation of monocytes into functional mature macrophages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16951326, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24942581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2823150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7604010}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (PubMed:12089508, PubMed:16331979, PubMed:2214026, PubMed:9641677).

CD4,P01903,"HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR alpha chain (MHC class II antigen DRA)",HLA-DRA1,"FUNCTION: An alpha chain of antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecule. In complex with the beta chain HLA-DRB, displays antigenic peptides on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-DR-restricted CD4-positive T cells. This guides antigen-specific T-helper effector functions, both antibody-mediated immune response and macrophage activation, to ultimately eliminate the infectious agents and transformed cells (PubMed:15265931, PubMed:15322540, PubMed:17334368, PubMed:22327072, PubMed:24190431, PubMed:27591323, PubMed:29884618, PubMed:31495665, PubMed:8145819, PubMed:9075930). Typically presents extracellular peptide antigens of 10 to 30 amino acids that arise from proteolysis of endocytosed antigens in lysosomes (PubMed:8145819). In the tumor microenvironment, presents antigenic peptides that are primarily generated in tumor-resident APCs likely via phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells or macropinocytosis of secreted tumor proteins (PubMed:31495665). Presents peptides derived from intracellular proteins that are trapped in autolysosomes after macroautophagy, a mechanism especially relevant for T cell selection in the thymus and central immune tolerance (PubMed:17182262, PubMed:23783831). The selection of the immunodominant epitopes follows two processing modes: 'bind first, cut/trim later' for pathogen-derived antigenic peptides and 'cut first, bind later' for autoantigens/self-peptides (PubMed:25413013).

CD4,P04234,T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 delta chain (T-cell receptor T3 delta chain) (CD antigen CD3d),T3D,"FUNCTION: Part of the TCR-CD3 complex present on T-lymphocyte cell surface that plays an essential role in adaptive immune response. When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:2470098). In addition of this role of signal transduction in T-cell activation, CD3D plays an essential role in thymocyte differentiation. Indeed, participates in correct intracellular TCR-CD3 complex assembly and surface expression. In absence of a functional TCR-CD3 complex, thymocytes are unable to differentiate properly. Interacts with CD4 and CD8 and thus serves to establish a functional link between the TCR and coreceptors CD4 and CD8, which is needed for activation and positive selection of CD4 or CD8 T-cells (PubMed:12215456). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12215456, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12507424, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2470098}.",,,identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; transmembrane signaling receptor activity [GO:0004888],"DISEASE: Immunodeficiency 19, severe combined (IMD19) [MIM:615617]: An autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by onset in early infancy of recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.",,,clathrin binding [GO:0030276]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048],,

Exerts distinct biological functions in the mammary epithelial cells and T cells in a tissue-specific manner. Necessary and sufficient for commitment of CD4 lineage, while its absence causes CD8 commitment. Development of immature T-cell precursors (thymocytes) to either the CD4 helper or CD8 killer T-cell lineages correlates precisely with their T-cell receptor specificity for major histocompatibility complex class II or class I molecules, respectively. Cross-antagonism between ZBTB7B and CBF complexes are determinative to CD4 versus CD8 cell fate decision. Suppresses RUNX3 expression and imposes CD4+ lineage fate by inducing the SOCS suppressors of cytokine signaling. induces, as a transcriptional activator, SOCS genes expression which represses RUNX3 expression and promotes the CD4+ lineage fate. During CD4 lineage commitment, associates with multiple sites at the CD8 locus, acting as a negative regulator of the CD8 promoter and enhancers by epigenetic silencing through the recruitment of class II histone deacetylases, such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, to these loci. Regulates the development of IL17-producing CD1d-restricted naural killer (NK) T cells. Also functions as an important metabolic regulator in the lactating mammary glands.

IL-27 has pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, that can regulate T-helper cell development, suppress T-cell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic T-cell activity, induce isotype switching in B-cells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 T-helper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper T-cells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma/IFN-gamma production of naive CD4 T-cells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL-27-mediated signal transduction. IL-27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21- and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERK-dependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/T-Bet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 up-regulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 T-cells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL-27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL-17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. While IL-27 suppressed the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of anti-inflammatory inducible regulatory T-cells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL-27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL-27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on T-cells. Another important role of IL-27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II.

CCR5,P32121,Beta-arrestin-2 (Arrestin beta-2) (Non-visual arrestin-3),ARB2 ARR2,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity.

Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs.

During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Involved in internalization of P2RY4 and UTP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 ands subsequent recycling. Involved in the degradation of cAMP by recruiting cAMP phosphodiesterases to ligand-activated receptors. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold is largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Recruits c-Src/SRC to ADRB2 resulting in ERK activation. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Is required for SP-stimulated endocytosis of NK1R and recruits c-Src/SRC to internalized NK1R resulting in ERK1/2 activation, which is required for the antiapoptotic effects of SP. Is involved in proteinase-activated F2RL1-mediated ERK activity. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. Is involved in alpha-thrombin-stimulated AKT1 signaling. Is involved in IGF1-stimulated AKT1 signaling leading to increased protection from apoptosis. Involved in activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and in actin bundle formation. Involved in F2RL1-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis. Involved in AGTR1-mediated stress fiber formation by acting together with GNAQ to activate RHOA. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Involved in OPRD1-stimulated transcriptional regulation by translocating to CDKN1B and FOS promoter regions and recruiting EP300 resulting in acetylation of histone H4. Involved in regulation of LEF1 transcriptional activity via interaction with DVL1 and/or DVL2 Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN. Binds phosphoinositides. Binds inositolhexakisphosphate (InsP6) (By similarity). Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced RAC1-LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. Involved in the internalization of the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3. Negatively regulates the NOTCH signaling pathway by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH1 by ITCH. Participates in the recruitment of the ubiquitin-protein ligase to the receptor (PubMed:23886940). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12464600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14711824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15475570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15611106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15878855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16144840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16280323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16378096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16492667, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16709866, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18337459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18419762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19620252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19643177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22457824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23341447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23633677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23886940}.",,,angiotensin receptor binding [GO:0031701]; arrestin family protein binding [GO:1990763]; enzyme inhibitor activity [GO:0004857]; G protein-coupled receptor binding [GO:0001664]; GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]; insulin-like growth factor receptor binding [GO:0005159]; transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625],,CHEMBL1795088;

Receptor for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone (PubMed:10529478, PubMed:10836142, PubMed:12589820, PubMed:19300905, PubMed:7891175, PubMed:7905839, PubMed:7957926, PubMed:9689128). Also activated by enkephalin peptides, such as Met-enkephalin or Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, with higher affinity for Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (By similarity). Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors (PubMed:7905839). The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extent to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15 (PubMed:12068084). They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B (By similarity). Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins (By similarity). The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4 (By similarity). Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization (By similarity). Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction (By similarity). The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins (By similarity). The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation (By similarity). Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling (By similarity). Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling (By similarity). Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling (By similarity). Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P33535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10529478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7891175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7905839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7957926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9689128, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10836142, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19300905}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 12]: Couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20525224}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 16]: Does not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16580639}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 17]: Does not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16580639}.",,,beta-endorphin receptor activity [GO:0004979]; G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; G-protein alpha-subunit binding [GO:0001965]; G-protein beta-subunit binding [GO:0031681]; morphine receptor activity [GO:0038047]; neuropeptide binding [GO:0042923]; voltage-gated calcium channel activity [GO:0005245],,CHEMBL233;

KCNH2,Q14721,Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily B member 1 (Delayed rectifier potassium channel 1) (DRK1) (h-DRK1) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv2.1),,"FUNCTION: Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain, but also in the pancreas and cardiovascular system. Contributes to the regulation of the action potential (AP) repolarization, duration and frequency of repetitive AP firing in neurons, muscle cells and endocrine cells and plays a role in homeostatic attenuation of electrical excitability throughout the brain (PubMed:23161216). Plays also a role in the regulation of exocytosis independently of its electrical function (By similarity). Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane. Homotetrameric channels mediate a delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent outward potassium current that display rapid activation and slow inactivation in response to membrane depolarization (PubMed:10484328, PubMed:12560340, PubMed:1283219, PubMed:19074135, PubMed:19717558, PubMed:24901643, PubMed:8081723). Can form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNB2; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (By similarity). Can also form functional heterotetrameric channels with other alpha subunits that are non-conducting when expressed alone, such as KCNF1, KCNG1, KCNG3, KCNG4, KCNH1, KCNH2, KCNS1, KCNS2, KCNS3 and KCNV1, creating a functionally diverse range of channel complexes (PubMed:10484328, PubMed:11852086, PubMed:12060745, PubMed:19074135, PubMed:19717558, PubMed:24901643). Heterotetrameric channel activity formed with KCNS3 show increased current amplitude with the threshold for action potential activation shifted towards more negative values in hypoxic-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (By similarity). Channel properties are also modulated by cytoplasmic ancillary beta subunits such as AMIGO1, KCNE1, KCNE2 and KCNE3, slowing activation and inactivation rate of the delayed rectifier potassium channels (By similarity). In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member. Major contributor to the slowly inactivating delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium current in neurons of the central nervous system, sympathetic ganglion neurons, neuroendocrine cells, pancreatic beta cells, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells. Mediates the major part of the somatodendritic delayed-rectifier potassium current in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons and sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (CGC) neurons that acts to slow down periods of firing, especially during high frequency stimulation. Plays a role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of neuron excitability in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of glucose-induced action potential amplitude and duration in pancreatic beta cells, hence limiting calcium influx and insulin secretion (PubMed:23161216). Plays a role in the regulation of resting membrane potential and contraction in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. May contribute to the regulation of the duration of both the action potential of cardiomyocytes and the heart ventricular repolarization QT interval. Contributes to the pronounced pro-apoptotic potassium current surge during neuronal apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative injury. May confer neuroprotection in response to hypoxia/ischemic insults by suppressing pyramidal neurons hyperexcitability in hippocampal and cortical regions (By similarity). Promotes trafficking of KCNG3, KCNH1 and KCNH2 to the cell surface membrane, presumably by forming heterotetrameric channels with these subunits (PubMed:12060745). Plays a role in the calcium-dependent recruitment and release of fusion-competent vesicles from the soma of neurons, neuroendocrine and glucose-induced pancreatic beta cells by binding key components of the fusion machinery in a pore-independent manner (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P15387, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484328, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11852086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12060745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12560340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1283219, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19074135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19717558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23161216, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24901643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8081723}.",,,delayed rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005251]; outward rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0015271]; protein heterodimerization activity [GO:0046982]; SNARE binding [GO:0000149]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325],"DISEASE: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 26 (DEE26) [MIM:616056]: A form of epileptic encephalopathy, a heterogeneous group of severe early-onset epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures, neurodevelopmental impairment, and poor prognosis.

KCNH2,P0DMV8,Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1) (HSP70-1) (HSP70.1) (Heat shock protein family A member 1A),HSP72 HSPA1 HSX70,"FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including protection of the proteome from stress, folding and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides, activation of proteolysis of misfolded proteins and the formation and dissociation of protein complexes. Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation. This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones. The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation. The affinity for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. It goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones such as HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24012426, PubMed:24318877, PubMed:26865365). Maintains protein homeostasis during cellular stress through two opposing mechanisms: protein refolding and degradation. Its acetylation/deacetylation state determines whether it functions in protein refolding or protein degradation by controlling the competitive binding of co-chaperones HOPX and STUB1. During the early stress response, the acetylated form binds to HOPX which assists in chaperone-mediated protein refolding, thereafter, it is deacetylated and binds to ubiquitin ligase STUB1 that promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (PubMed:27708256). Regulates centrosome integrity during mitosis, and is required for the maintenance of a functional mitotic centrosome that supports the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle (PubMed:27137183). Enhances STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation and facilitates STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling (PubMed:24613385). Essential for STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) during inflammation (PubMed:23973223). Required as a co-chaperone for optimal STUB1/CHIP ubiquitination of NFATC3 (By similarity).

Navs, also called VGSCs (voltage-gated sodium channels) or VDSCs (voltage-dependent sodium channels), operate by switching between closed and open conformations depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. In the open conformation they allow Na(+) ions to selectively pass through the pore, along their electrochemical gradient. The influx of Na(+) ions provokes membrane depolarization, initiating the propagation of electrical signals throughout cells and tissues (PubMed:1309946, PubMed:21447824, PubMed:23085483, PubMed:23420830, PubMed:25370050, PubMed:26279430, PubMed:26392562, PubMed:26776555).

Associates with KCNE beta subunits that modulates current kinetics (PubMed:10646604, PubMed:11101505, PubMed:19687231, PubMed:8900283, PubMed:9108097, PubMed:9312006). Induces a voltage-dependent current by rapidly activating and slowly deactivating potassium-selective outward current (PubMed:10646604, PubMed:11101505, PubMed:25441029, PubMed:8900283, PubMed:9108097, PubMed:9312006). Promotes also a delayed voltage activated potassium current showing outward rectification characteristic (By similarity). During beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, participates in cardiac repolarization by associating with KCNE1 to form the I(Ks) cardiac potassium current that increases the amplitude and slows down the activation kinetics of outward potassium current I(Ks) (By similarity) (PubMed:10646604, PubMed:11101505, PubMed:8900283, PubMed:9108097, PubMed:9312006). Muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M strongly suppresses KCNQ1/KCNE1 current (PubMed:10713961). When associated with KCNE3, forms the potassium channel that is important for cyclic AMP-stimulated intestinal secretion of chloride ions (PubMed:10646604). This interaction with KCNE3 is reduced by 17beta-estradiol, resulting in the reduction of currents (By similarity). During conditions of increased substrate load, maintains the driving force for proximal tubular and intestinal sodium ions absorption, gastric acid secretion, and cAMP-induced jejunal chloride ions secretion (By similarity). Allows the provision of potassium ions to the luminal membrane of the secretory canaliculus in the resting state as well as during stimulated acid secretion (By similarity). When associated with KCNE2, forms a heterooligomer complex leading to currents with an apparently instantaneous activation, a rapid deactivation process and a linear current-voltage relationship and decreases the amplitude of the outward current (PubMed:11101505). When associated with KCNE4, inhibits voltage-gated potassium channel activity (PubMed:19687231). When associated with KCNE5, this complex only conducts current upon strong and continued depolarization (PubMed:12324418). Also forms a heterotetramer with KCNQ5; has a voltage-gated potassium channel activity (PubMed:24855057). Binds with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PubMed:25037568). KCNQ1-KCNE2 channel associates with Na(+)-coupled myo-inositol symporter in the apical membrane of choroid plexus epithelium and regulates the myo-inositol gradient between blood and cerebrospinal fluid with an impact on neuron excitability (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97414, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0N7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10646604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10713961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11101505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12324418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19687231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24595108, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24855057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25037568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8900283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9108097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9312006}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Non-functional alone but modulatory when coexpressed with the full-length isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9305853}.",,,"calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; delayed rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005251]; outward rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0015271]; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]; protein kinase A catalytic subunit binding [GO:0034236]; protein kinase A regulatory subunit binding [GO:0034237]; protein phosphatase 1 binding [GO:0008157]; scaffold protein binding [GO:0097110]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity [GO:0005249]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity involved in atrial cardiac muscle cell action potential repolarization [GO:0086089]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity involved in cardiac muscle cell action potential repolarization [GO:0086008]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity involved in ventricular cardiac muscle cell action potential repolarization [GO:1902282]","DISEASE: Long QT syndrome 1 (LQT1) [MIM:192500]: A heart disorder characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the ECG and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias.
