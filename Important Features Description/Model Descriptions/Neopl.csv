Essential component of a neuregulin-receptor complex, although neuregulins do not interact with it alone. GP30 is a potential ligand for this receptor. Regulates outgrowth and stabilization of peripheral microtubules (MTs). Upon ERBB2 activation, the MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway elicits the phosphorylation and thus the inhibition of GSK3B at cell membrane. This prevents the phosphorylation of APC and CLASP2, allowing its association with the cell membrane. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization. {ECO:0000305}.; FUNCTION: In the nucleus is involved in transcriptional regulation.

Required for normal cardiac muscle differentiation during embryonic development, and for postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. Required for normal development of the embryonic central nervous system, especially for normal neural crest cell migration and normal axon guidance. Required for mammary gland differentiation, induction of milk proteins and lactation. Acts as cell-surface receptor for the neuregulins NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4 and the EGF family members BTC, EREG and HBEGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues that then serve as binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Ligand specificity and signaling is modulated by alternative splicing, proteolytic processing, and by the formation of heterodimers with other ERBB family members, thereby creating multiple combinations of intracellular phosphotyrosines that trigger ligand- and context-specific cellular responses. Mediates phosphorylation of SHC1 and activation of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 phosphorylate PIK3R1, leading to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT1 and protect cells against apoptosis. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 mediate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promote cell migration in response to NRG1. Isoform JM-A CYT-2 and isoform JM-B CYT-2 lack the phosphotyrosine that mediates interaction with PIK3R1, and hence do not phosphorylate PIK3R1, do not protect cells against apoptosis, and do not promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Proteolytic processing of isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-A CYT-2 gives rise to the corresponding soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) that translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear import of STAT5A, activation of STAT5A, mammary epithelium differentiation, cell proliferation and activation of gene expression. The ERBB4 soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) colocalize with STAT5A at the CSN2 promoter to regulate transcription of milk proteins during lactation.

Pol I-mediated transcription cycle proceeds through transcription initiation, transcription elongation and transcription termination stages. During transcription initiation, Pol I pre-initiation complex (PIC) is recruited by the selectivity factor 1 (SL1/TIF-IB) complex bound to the core promoter that precedes an rDNA repeat unit. The PIC assembly bends the promoter favoring the formation of the transcription bubble and promoter escape. Once the polymerase has escaped from the promoter it enters the elongation phase during which RNA is actively polymerized, based on complementarity with the template DNA strand. Highly processive, assembles in structures referred to as 'Miller trees' where many elongating Pol I complexes queue and transcribe the same rDNA coding regions.

These include the RNA-binding proteins: KHDRBS1/SAM68, KHDRBS2/SLM1, KHDRBS3/SLM2 and SFPQ/PSF; transcription factors: STAT3 and STAT5A/B and a variety of signaling molecules: ARHGAP35/p190RhoGAP, PXN/paxillin, BTK/ATK, STAP2/BKS. Associates also with a variety of proteins that are likely upstream of PTK6 in various signaling pathways, or for which PTK6 may play an adapter-like role. These proteins include ADAM15, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3 and IRS4. In normal or non-tumorigenic tissues, PTK6 promotes cellular differentiation and apoptosis. In tumors PTK6 contributes to cancer progression by sensitizing cells to mitogenic signals and enhancing proliferation, anchorage-independent survival and migration/invasion. Association with EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3 may contribute to mammary tumor development and growth through enhancement of EGF-induced signaling via BTK/AKT and PI3 kinase. Contributes to migration and proliferation by contributing to EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ARHGAP35/p190RhoGAP, which promotes association with RASA1/p120RasGAP, inactivating RhoA while activating RAS. EGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of PNX/Paxillin by PTK6 and activation of RAC1 via CRK/CrKII, thereby promoting migration and invasion. PTK6 activates STAT3 and STAT5B to promote proliferation. Nuclear PTK6 may be important for regulating growth in normal epithelia, while cytoplasmic PTK6 might activate oncogenic signaling pathways.; FUNCTION: Isoform 2 inhibits PTK6 phosphorylation and PTK6 association with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.","ACT_SITE 312; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10028""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004715]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102],,CHEMBL4601;

Along with AP-1 complex, involved Golgi apparatus - endosome sorting (PubMed:17646382). Sorting receptor for APP, regulating its intracellular trafficking and processing into amyloidogenic-beta peptides. Retains APP in the trans-Golgi network, hence preventing its transit through late endosomes where amyloid beta peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 are generated (PubMed:16174740, PubMed:16407538, PubMed:17855360, PubMed:24523320). May also sort newly produced amyloid-beta peptides to lysosomes for catabolism (PubMed:24523320). Does not affect APP trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi compartments (PubMed:17855360). Sorting receptor for the BDNF receptor NTRK2/TRKB that facilitates NTRK2 trafficking between synaptic plasma membranes, postsynaptic densities and cell soma, hence positively regulates BDNF signaling by controlling the intracellular location of its receptor (PubMed:23977241). Sorting receptor for GDNF that promotes GDNF regulated, but not constitutive secretion (PubMed:21994944). Sorting receptor for the GDNF-GFRA1 complex, directing it from the cell surface to endosomes. GDNF is then targeted to lysosomes and degraded, while its receptor GFRA1 recycles back to the cell membrane, resulting in a GDNF clearance pathway. The SORL1-GFRA1 complex further targets RET for endocytosis, but not for degradation, affecting GDNF-induced neurotrophic activities (PubMed:23333276). Sorting receptor for ERBB2/HER2. Regulates ERBB2 subcellular distribution by promoting its recycling after internalization from endosomes back to the plasma membrane, hence stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent ERBB2 signaling. In ERBB2-dependent cancer cells, promotes cell proliferation (PubMed:31138794). Sorting receptor for lipoprotein lipase LPL. Promotes LPL localization to endosomes and later to the lysosomes, leading to degradation of newly synthesized LPL (PubMed:21385844). Potential sorting receptor for APOA5, inducing APOA5 internalization to early endosomes, then to late endosomes, wherefrom a portion is sent to lysosomes and degradation, another portion is sorted to the trans-Golgi network (PubMed:18603531). Sorting receptor for the insulin receptor INSR. Promotes recycling of internalized INSR via the Golgi apparatus back to the cell surface, thereby preventing lysosomal INSR catabolism, increasing INSR cell surface expression and strengthening insulin signal reception in adipose tissue. Does not affect INSR internalization (PubMed:27322061). Plays a role in renal ion homeostasis, controlling the phospho-regulation of SLC12A1/NKCC2 by STK39/SPAK kinase and PPP3CB/calcineurin A beta phosphatase, possibly through intracellular sorting of STK39 and PPP3CB (By similarity). Stimulates, via the N-terminal ectodomain, the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, possibly by increasing cell surface expression of the urokinase receptor uPAR/PLAUR. This may promote extracellular matrix proteolysis and hence facilitate cell migration (PubMed:14764453). By acting on the migration of intimal smooth muscle cells, may accelerate intimal thickening following vascular injury (PubMed:14764453). Promotes adhesion of monocytes (PubMed:23486467). Stimulates proliferation and migration of monocytes/macrophages (By similarity). Through its action on intimal smooth muscle cells and macrophages, may accelerate intimal thickening and macrophage foam cell formation in the process of atherosclerosis (By similarity). Regulates hypoxia-enhanced adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the bone marrow stromal cells via a PLAUR-mediated pathway. This function is mediated by the N-terminal ectodomain (PubMed:23486467). Metabolic regulator, which functions to maintain the adequate balance between lipid storage and oxidation in response to changing environmental conditions, such as temperature and diet. The N-terminal ectodomain negatively regulates adipose tissue energy expenditure, acting through the inhibition the BMP/Smad pathway (By similarity). May regulate signaling by the heterodimeric neurotrophic cytokine CLCF1-CRLF1 bound to the CNTFR receptor by promoting the endocytosis of the tripartite complex CLCF1-CRLF1-CNTFR and lysosomal degradation (PubMed:26858303). May regulate IL6 signaling, decreasing cis signaling, possibly by interfering with IL6-binding to membrane-bound IL6R, while up-regulating trans signaling via soluble IL6R (PubMed:28265003). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O88307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14764453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16174740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17646382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17855360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18603531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21385844, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21994944, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23333276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23486467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23977241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24523320, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26858303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27322061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28265003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31138794, ECO:0000305}.",,,amyloid-beta binding [GO:0001540]; aspartic-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0019828]; low-density lipoprotein particle binding [GO:0030169]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor activity [GO:0005041]; neuropeptide binding [GO:0042923]; small GTPase binding [GO:0031267]; transmembrane signaling receptor activity [GO:0004888],"DISEASE: Alzheimer disease (AD) [MIM:104300]: Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, loss of cognitive abilities, and deposition of fibrillar amyloid proteins as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN.

CDK4,P06400,Retinoblastoma-associated protein (p105-Rb) (p110-RB1) (pRb) (Rb) (pp110),,"FUNCTION: Tumor suppressor that is a key regulator of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (PubMed:10499802). The hypophosphorylated form binds transcription regulators of the E2F family, preventing transcription of E2F-responsive genes (PubMed:10499802). Both physically blocks E2Fs transactivating domain and recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes that actively repress transcription (PubMed:10499802). Cyclin and CDK-dependent phosphorylation of RB1 induces its dissociation from E2Fs, thereby activating transcription of E2F responsive genes and triggering entry into S phase (PubMed:10499802). RB1 also promotes the G0-G1 transition upon phosphorylation and activation by CDK3/cyclin-C (PubMed:15084261). Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, KMT5B and KMT5C, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13405, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P33568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10499802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1316611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17974914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18701596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2839300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8892909}.",,,disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; importin-alpha family protein binding [GO:0061676]; kinase binding [GO:0019900]; molecular adaptor activity [GO:0060090]; phosphoprotein binding [GO:0051219]; RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000977]; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0061629]; transcription corepressor activity [GO:0003714]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625],"DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by the binding to a cyclin and mediate the progression through the cell cycle. Each different complex controls a specific transition between 2 subsequent phases in the cell cycle. Required for both activation and complex formation of CDK1/cyclin-B during G2-M transition, and for activation of CDK2/cyclins during G1-S transition (but not complex formation). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. Phosphorylates SPT5/SUPT5H, SF1/NR5A1, POLR2A, p53/TP53, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and CDK11B/CDK11. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts (PubMed:9852112). Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Its expression and activity are constant throughout the cell cycle. Upon DNA damage, triggers p53/TP53 activation by phosphorylation, but is inactivated in turn by p53/TP53; this feedback loop may lead to an arrest of the cell cycle and of the transcription, helping in cell recovery, or to apoptosis. Required for DNA-bound peptides-mediated transcription and cellular growth inhibition. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10024882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11113184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16327805, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17373709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17386261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17901130, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19015234, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19071173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19136461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19450536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20360007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9372954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9852112}.","ACT_SITE 137; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15530371""",,"ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP-dependent activity, acting on DNA [GO:0008094]; cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004693]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat kinase activity [GO:0008353]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat S2 kinase activity [GO:0140834]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat S5 kinase activity [GO:0140836]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat S7 kinase activity [GO:0140837]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat T4 kinase activity [GO:0140835]; RNA polymerase II CTD heptapeptide repeat Y1 kinase activity [GO:0140833]",,CHEMBL3055;

Transcribes 47S pre-rRNAs from multicopy rRNA gene clusters, giving rise to 5.8S, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (PubMed:11250903, PubMed:11283244, PubMed:16858408, PubMed:34671025, PubMed:34887565, PubMed:36271492). Pol I-mediated transcription cycle proceeds through transcription initiation, transcription elongation and transcription termination stages. During transcription initiation, Pol I pre-initiation complex (PIC) is recruited by the selectivity factor 1 (SL1/TIF-IB) complex bound to the core promoter that precedes an rDNA repeat unit. The PIC assembly bends the promoter favoring the formation of the transcription bubble and promoter escape. Once the polymerase has escaped from the promoter it enters the elongation phase during which RNA is actively polymerized, based on complementarity with the template DNA strand. Highly processive, assembles in structures referred to as 'Miller trees' where many elongating Pol I complexes queue and transcribe the same rDNA coding regions. At terminator sequences downstream of the rDNA gene, PTRF interacts with Pol I and halts Pol I transcription leading to the release of the RNA transcript and polymerase from the DNA (PubMed:11250903, PubMed:11283244, PubMed:16858408, PubMed:34671025, PubMed:34887565, PubMed:36271492). Forms Pol I active center together with the second largest subunit POLR1B/RPA2. Appends one nucleotide at a time to the 3' end of the nascent RNA, with POLR1A/RPA1 contributing a Mg(2+)-coordinating DxDGD motif, and POLR1B/RPA2 participating in the coordination of a second Mg(2+) ion and providing lysine residues believed to facilitate Watson-Crick base pairing between the incoming nucleotide and the template base. Typically, Mg(2+) ions direct a 5' nucleoside triphosphate to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3' hydroxyl of the preceding nucleotide of the nascent RNA, with the elimination of pyrophosphate. Has proofreading activity: Pauses and backtracks to allow the cleavage of a missincorporated nucleotide via POLR1H/RPA12.

The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases.

Upon ionizing radiation treatment, is required for the activation of the apoptosis regulators BAX and BAK, which trigger the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Can phosphorylate MCL1 and target it for degradation which is sufficient to trigger for BAX activation and apoptosis. Is required for the control of cell cycle progression both at G1/S and G2/M phases. Mediates phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced inhibition of cell cycle progression at G1/S phase by up-regulating the CDK inhibitor CDKN1A/p21 and inhibiting the cyclin CCNA2 promoter activity. In response to UV irradiation can phosphorylate CDK1, which is important for the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation (By similarity). Can protect glioma cells from the apoptosis induced by TNFSF10/TRAIL, probably by inducing increased phosphorylation and subsequent activation of AKT1 (PubMed:15774464). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells and promotes cell survival and resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs by inducing cyclin D1 (CCND1) and hyperphosphorylation of RB1, and via several pro-survival pathways, including NF-kappa-B, AKT1 and MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2). Involved in antifungal immunity by mediating phosphorylation and activation of CARD9 downstream of C-type lectin receptors activation, promoting interaction between CARD9 and BCL10, followed by activation of NF-kappa-B and MAP kinase p38 pathways (By similarity). Can also act as tumor suppressor upon mitogenic stimulation with PMA or TPA. In N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-treated cells, is required for NCF1 (p47-phox) phosphorylation and activation of NADPH oxidase activity, and regulates TNF-elicited superoxide anion production in neutrophils, by direct phosphorylation and activation of NCF1 or indirectly through MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways (PubMed:19801500). May also play a role in the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity in eosinophil after stimulation with IL5, leukotriene B4 or PMA (PubMed:11748588). In collagen-induced platelet aggregation, acts a negative regulator of filopodia formation and actin polymerization by interacting with and negatively regulating VASP phosphorylation (PubMed:16940418). Downstream of PAR1, PAR4 and CD36/GP4 receptors, regulates differentially platelet dense granule secretion; acts as a positive regulator in PAR-mediated granule secretion, whereas it negatively regulates CD36/GP4-mediated granule release (PubMed:19587372). Phosphorylates MUC1 in the C-terminal and regulates the interaction between MUC1 and beta-catenin (PubMed:11877440). The catalytic subunit phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAB, YWHAZ and YWHAH) in a sphingosine-dependent fashion (By similarity). Phosphorylates ELAVL1 in response to angiotensin-2 treatment (PubMed:18285462). Phosphorylates mitochondrial phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3), resulting in increased cardiolipin expression on the mitochondrial outer membrane which facilitates apoptosis (PubMed:12649167).

Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoclast proliferation and differentiation, the regulation of bone resorption, and is required for normal bone and tooth development. Required for normal male and female fertility, and for normal development of milk ducts and acinar structures in the mammary gland during pregnancy. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, regulates formation of membrane ruffles, cell adhesion and cell migration, and promotes cancer cell invasion. Activates several signaling pathways in response to ligand binding, including the ERK1/2 and the JNK pathway (PubMed:20504948, PubMed:30982609). Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG2, GRB2, SLA2 and CBL. Activation of PLCG2 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, that then lead to the activation of protein kinase C family members, especially PRKCD. Phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leads to activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. Binds via DLX1 to enhancers located in the intergenic region between DLX5 and DLX6 and this binding is stabilized by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Evf2 (By similarity).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner (PubMed:29374058, PubMed:8804307). Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state.

As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells.

Plays a crucial role as a transcriptional coregulator in various cellular pathways, including the STAT pathway, the p53 pathway and the steroid hormone signaling pathway. The effects of this transcriptional coregulation, transactivation or silencing may vary depending upon the biological context and the PIAS2 isoform studied. However, it seems to be mostly involved in gene silencing. Binds to sumoylated ELK1 and enhances its transcriptional activity by preventing recruitment of HDAC2 by ELK1, thus reversing SUMO-mediated repression of ELK1 transactivation activity. Isoform PIAS2-beta, but not isoform PIAS2-alpha, promotes MDM2 sumoylation. Isoform PIAS2-alpha promotes PARK7 sumoylation. Isoform PIAS2-beta promotes NCOA2 sumoylation more efficiently than isoform PIAS2-alpha.

Mediates glutamate, aspartate, serine, histidine or tyrosine ADP-ribosylation of proteins: the ADP-D-ribosyl group of NAD(+) is transferred to the acceptor carboxyl group of target residues and further ADP-ribosyl groups are transferred to the 2'-position of the terminal adenosine moiety, building up a polymer with an average chain length of 20-30 units (PubMed:19764761, PubMed:25043379, PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:35393539, PubMed:7852410, PubMed:9315851). Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:33186521, PubMed:34874266). Specificity for the different amino acids is conferred by interacting factors, such as HPF1 and NMNAT1 (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33186521, PubMed:33589610, PubMed:34625544, PubMed:34874266). Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 confers serine specificity by completing the PARP1 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33186521, PubMed:33589610, PubMed:34625544, PubMed:34874266).

Following interaction with NMNAT1, catalyzes glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; NMNAT1 confers glutamate and aspartate specificity (By similarity). PARP1 initiates the repair of DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones (H2BS6ADPr and H3S10ADPr), thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:17177976, PubMed:18172500, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:19661379, PubMed:23230272, PubMed:27067600, PubMed:34465625, PubMed:34874266). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP1 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:33683197, PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). In addition to base excision repair (BER) pathway, also involved in double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair: together with TIMELESS, accumulates at DNA damage sites and promotes homologous recombination repair by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:26344098, PubMed:30356214). Mediates the poly-ADP-ribosylation of a number of proteins, including itself, APLF, CHFR, RPA1 and NFAT5 (PubMed:17396150, PubMed:19764761, PubMed:24906880, PubMed:34049076). In addition to proteins, also able to ADP-ribosylate DNA: catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of DNA strand break termini containing terminal phosphates and a 2'-OH group in single- and double-stranded DNA, respectively (PubMed:27471034). Required for PARP9 and DTX3L recruitment to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-mediated DNA repair in neurons plays a role in sleep: senses DNA damage in neurons and promotes sleep, facilitating efficient DNA repair (By similarity). In addition to DNA repair, also involved in other processes, such as transcription regulation, programmed cell death, membrane repair, adipogenesis and innate immunity (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:17177976, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:27256882, PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35124853, PubMed:35393539, PubMed:35460603). Acts as a repressor of transcription: binds to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure in a manner similar to histone H1, thereby altering RNA polymerase II (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:22464733). Acts both as a positive and negative regulator of transcription elongation, depending on the context (PubMed:27256882, PubMed:35393539). Acts as a positive regulator of transcription elongation by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of NELFE, preventing RNA-binding activity of NELFE and relieving transcription pausing (PubMed:27256882). Acts as a negative regulator of transcription elongation in response to DNA damage by catalyzing poly-ADP-ribosylation of CCNT1, disrupting the phase separation activity of CCNT1 and subsequent activation of CDK9 (PubMed:35393539). Involved in replication fork progression following interaction with CARM1: mediates poly-ADP-ribosylation at replication forks, slowing fork progression (PubMed:33412112). Poly-ADP-ribose chains generated by PARP1 also play a role in poly-ADP-ribose-dependent cell death, a process named parthanatos (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35460603). Acts by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of CGAS: PARP1 translocates into the cytosol following phosphorylation by PRKDC and catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of CGAS (PubMed:35460603). Acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis: catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B on 'Glu-35' (H2BE35ADPr) following interaction with NMNAT1, inhibiting phosphorylation of H2B at 'Ser-36' (H2BS36ph), thereby blocking expression of pro-adipogenetic genes (By similarity).

Binds to 3 E-boxes of the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene promoter and to the promoters of CLDN7 and KRT8 and, in association with histone demethylase KDM1A which it recruits to the promoters, causes a decrease in dimethylated H3K4 levels and represses transcription (PubMed:10655587, PubMed:20389281, PubMed:20562920). The N-terminal SNAG domain competes with histone H3 for the same binding site on the histone demethylase complex formed by KDM1A and RCOR1, and thereby inhibits demethylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-4' (in vitro) (PubMed:20389281, PubMed:21300290, PubMed:23721412).

PARP1,P09884,DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit (EC 2.7.7.7) (DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit p180),POLA,"FUNCTION: Catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha complex (also known as the alpha DNA polymerase-primase complex) which plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA synthesis. During the S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA polymerase alpha complex (composed of a catalytic subunit POLA1, a regulatory subunit POLA2 and two primase subunits PRIM1 and PRIM2) is recruited to DNA at the replicative forks via direct interactions with MCM10 and WDHD1. The primase subunit of the polymerase alpha complex initiates DNA synthesis by oligomerising short RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands. These primers are initially extended by the polymerase alpha catalytic subunit and subsequently transferred to polymerase delta and polymerase epsilon for processive synthesis on the lagging and leading strand, respectively. The reason this transfer occurs is because the polymerase alpha has limited processivity and lacks intrinsic 3' exonuclease activity for proofreading error, and therefore is not well suited for replicating long complexes. In the cytosol, responsible for a substantial proportion of the physiological concentration of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids, which are necessary to prevent spontaneous activation of type I interferon responses (PubMed:27019227). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26975377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27019227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31006512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9518481}.",,,chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA replication origin binding [GO:0003688]; DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity [GO:0003887]; nucleotide binding [GO:0000166]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270],"DISEASE: Pigmentary disorder, reticulate, with systemic manifestations, X-linked (PDR) [MIM:301220]: An X-linked recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections and sterile inflammation in various organs.

Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-CCGCCATNTT-3'; some genes have been shown to contain a longer binding motif allowing enhanced binding; the initial CG dinucleotide can be methylated greatly reducing the binding affinity (PubMed:15329343, PubMed:17721549, PubMed:24326773, PubMed:25787250). The effect on transcription regulation is depending upon the context in which it binds and diverse mechanisms of action include direct activation or repression, indirect activation or repression via cofactor recruitment, or activation or repression by disruption of binding sites or conformational DNA changes (PubMed:15329343, PubMed:17721549, PubMed:24326773, PubMed:25787250).

PARP1,Q8N884,Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAMP synthase) (cGAS) (h-cGAS) (EC 2.7.7.86) (2'3'-cGAMP synthase) (Mab-21 domain-containing protein 1),C6orf150 MB21D1,"FUNCTION: Nucleotidyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP-AMP (2',3'-cGAMP) from ATP and GTP and plays a key role in innate immunity (PubMed:21478870, PubMed:23258413, PubMed:23707061, PubMed:23707065, PubMed:23722159, PubMed:24077100, PubMed:24116191, PubMed:24462292, PubMed:25131990, PubMed:26300263, PubMed:29976794, PubMed:30799039, PubMed:31142647, PubMed:32814054, PubMed:33273464, PubMed:33542149, PubMed:37217469, PubMed:37802025). Catalysis involves both the formation of a 2',5' phosphodiester linkage at the GpA step and the formation of a 3',5' phosphodiester linkage at the ApG step, producing c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] (PubMed:28214358, PubMed:28363908). Acts as a key DNA sensor: directly binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), inducing the formation of liquid-like droplets in which CGAS is activated, leading to synthesis of 2',3'-cGAMP, a second messenger that binds to and activates STING1, thereby triggering type-I interferon production (PubMed:28314590, PubMed:28363908, PubMed:29976794, PubMed:32817552, PubMed:33230297, PubMed:33606975, PubMed:35322803, PubMed:35438208, PubMed:35460603, PubMed:35503863). Preferentially recognizes and binds curved long dsDNAs of a minimal length of 40 bp (PubMed:30007416). Acts as a key foreign DNA sensor, the presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm being a danger signal that triggers the immune responses (PubMed:28363908). Has antiviral activity by sensing the presence of dsDNA from DNA viruses in the cytoplasm (PubMed:28363908, PubMed:35613581). Also acts as an innate immune sensor of infection by retroviruses, such as HIV-2, by detecting the presence of reverse-transcribed DNA in the cytosol (PubMed:23929945, PubMed:24269171, PubMed:30270045, PubMed:32852081). In contrast, HIV-1 is poorly sensed by CGAS, due to its capsid that cloaks viral DNA from CGAS detection (PubMed:24269171, PubMed:30270045, PubMed:32852081). Detection of retroviral reverse-transcribed DNA in the cytosol may be indirect and be mediated via interaction with PQBP1, which directly binds reverse-transcribed retroviral DNA (PubMed:26046437). Also detects the presence of DNA from bacteria, such as M.tuberculosis (PubMed:26048138). 2',3'-cGAMP can be transferred from producing cells to neighboring cells through gap junctions, leading to promote STING1 activation and convey immune response to connecting cells (PubMed:24077100). 2',3'-cGAMP can also be transferred between cells by virtue of packaging within viral particles contributing to IFN-induction in newly infected cells in a cGAS-independent but STING1-dependent manner (PubMed:26229115). Also senses the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are translocated to the cytosol following phagocytosis, leading to synthesis of 2',3'-cGAMP (PubMed:33688080). In addition to foreign DNA, can also be activated by endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889, PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33031745, PubMed:33230297). When self-DNA leaks into the cytosol during cellular stress (such as mitochondrial stress, SARS-CoV-2 infection causing severe COVID-19 disease, DNA damage, mitotic arrest or senescence), or is present in form of cytosolic micronuclei, CGAS is activated leading to a state of sterile inflammation (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889, PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33031745, PubMed:33230297, PubMed:35045565). Acts as a regulator of cellular senescence by binding to cytosolic chromatin fragments that are present in senescent cells, leading to trigger type-I interferon production via STING1 and promote cellular senescence (By similarity). Also involved in the inflammatory response to genome instability and double-stranded DNA breaks: acts by localizing to micronuclei arising from genome instability (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889). Micronuclei, which are frequently found in cancer cells, consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane: following breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, CGAS binds self-DNA exposed to the cytosol, leading to 2',3'-cGAMP synthesis and subsequent activation of STING1 and type-I interferon production (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889). Activated in response to prolonged mitotic arrest, promoting mitotic cell death (PubMed:31299200). In a healthy cell, CGAS is however kept inactive even in cellular events that directly expose it to self-DNA, such as mitosis, when cGAS associates with chromatin directly after nuclear envelope breakdown or remains in the form of postmitotic persistent nuclear cGAS pools bound to chromatin (PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33542149). Nuclear CGAS is inactivated by chromatin via direct interaction with nucleosomes, which block CGAS from DNA binding and thus prevent CGAS-induced autoimmunity (PubMed:31299200, PubMed:32911482, PubMed:32912999, PubMed:33051594, PubMed:33542149). Also acts as a suppressor of DNA repair in response to DNA damage: inhibits homologous recombination repair by interacting with PARP1, the CGAS-PARP1 interaction leading to impede the formation of the PARP1-TIMELESS complex (PubMed:30356214, PubMed:31544964). In addition to DNA, also sense translation stress: in response to translation stress, translocates to the cytosol and associates with collided ribosomes, promoting its activation and triggering type-I interferon production (PubMed:34111399). In contrast to other mammals, human CGAS displays species-specific mechanisms of DNA recognition and produces less 2',3'-cGAMP, allowing a more fine-tuned response to pathogens (PubMed:30007416). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8C6L5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21478870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23258413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23707061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23707065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23722159, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23929945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24077100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24116191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24269171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24462292, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25131990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26046437, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26048138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26229115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26300263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28214358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28314590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28363908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28738408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28759889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29976794, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30007416, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30270045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30356214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30799039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31142647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31299200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31544964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32814054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32817552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32852081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32911482, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32912999, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33031745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33051594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33230297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33273464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33542149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33606975, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33688080, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34111399, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35045565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35322803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35438208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35460603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35503863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35613581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37217469, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37802025}.",,,"2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity [GO:0061501]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; double-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003690]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; molecular condensate scaffold activity [GO:0140693]; nucleosome binding [GO:0031491]; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]; poly-ADP-D-ribose modification-dependent protein binding [GO:0160004]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]",,CHEMBL4105728;

Mediates mono-ADP-ribosylation of glutamate, aspartate or lysine residues on target proteins (PubMed:20064938, PubMed:25043379). In contrast to PARP1 and PARP2, it is not able to mediate poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:25043379). Involved in DNA repair by mediating mono-ADP-ribosylation of a limited number of acceptor proteins involved in chromatin architecture and in DNA metabolism, such as histone H2B, XRCC5 and XRCC6 (PubMed:16924674, PubMed:24598253). ADP-ribosylation follows DNA damage and appears as an obligatory step in a detection/signaling pathway leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:16924674, PubMed:21211721, PubMed:21270334). Involved in single-strand break repair by catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B on 'Glu-2' (H2BE2ADPr) of nucleosomes containing nicked DNA (PubMed:27530147). Cooperates with the XRCC5-XRCC6 (Ku80-Ku70) heterodimer to limit end-resection thereby promoting accurate NHEJ (PubMed:24598253). Suppresses G-quadruplex (G4) structures in response to DNA damage (PubMed:28447610). Associates with a number of DNA repair factors and is involved in the response to exogenous and endogenous DNA strand breaks (PubMed:16924674, PubMed:21211721, PubMed:21270334). Together with APLF, promotes the retention of the LIG4-XRCC4 complex on chromatin and accelerate DNA ligation during non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (PubMed:21211721).

PARP1,Q86X55,Histone-arginine methyltransferase CARM1 (EC 2.1.1.319) (Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) (Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 4),PRMT4,"FUNCTION: Methylates (mono- and asymmetric dimethylation) the guanidino nitrogens of arginyl residues in several proteins involved in DNA packaging, transcription regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA stability (PubMed:12237300, PubMed:16497732, PubMed:19405910). Recruited to promoters upon gene activation together with histone acetyltransferases from EP300/P300 and p160 families, methylates histone H3 at 'Arg-17' (H3R17me), forming mainly asymmetric dimethylarginine (H3R17me2a), leading to activation of transcription via chromatin remodeling (PubMed:12237300, PubMed:16497732, PubMed:19405910). During nuclear hormone receptor activation and TCF7L2/TCF4 activation, acts synergically with EP300/P300 and either one of the p160 histone acetyltransferases NCOA1/SRC1, NCOA2/GRIP1 and NCOA3/ACTR or CTNNB1/beta-catenin to activate transcription (By similarity). During myogenic transcriptional activation, acts together with NCOA3/ACTR as a coactivator for MEF2C (By similarity). During monocyte inflammatory stimulation, acts together with EP300/P300 as a coactivator for NF-kappa-B (By similarity). Acts as a coactivator for PPARG, promotes adipocyte differentiation and the accumulation of brown fat tissue (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing by methylation of splicing factors (By similarity). Also seems to be involved in p53/TP53 transcriptional activation (By similarity). Methylates EP300/P300, both at 'Arg-2142', which may loosen its interaction with NCOA2/GRIP1, and at 'Arg-580' and 'Arg-604' in the KIX domain, which impairs its interaction with CREB and inhibits CREB-dependent transcriptional activation (PubMed:15731352). Also methylates arginine residues in RNA-binding proteins PABPC1, ELAVL1 and ELAV4, which may affect their mRNA-stabilizing properties and the half-life of their target mRNAs (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional coactivator of ACACA/acetyl-CoA carboxylase by enriching H3R17 methylation at its promoter, thereby positively regulating fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Independently of its methyltransferase activity, involved in replication fork progression: promotes PARP1 recruitment to replication forks, leading to poly-ADP-ribosylation of chromatin at replication forks and reduced fork speed (PubMed:33412112). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WVG6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12237300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15731352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19405910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33412112}.",,,beta-catenin binding [GO:0008013]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; histone arginine N-methyltransferase activity [GO:0008469]; histone H2AQ104 methyltransferase activity [GO:1990259]; histone H3K37 methyltransferase activity [GO:0062122]; histone H3K56 methyltransferase activity [GO:0140759]; histone H3R17 methyltransferase activity [GO:0035642]; histone H3R2 methyltransferase activity [GO:0070611]; histone H3R26 methyltransferase activity [GO:0140903]; histone H3R8 methyltransferase activity [GO:0140592]; histone H4K12 methyltransferase activity [GO:0140984]; histone H4R3 methyltransferase activity [GO:0044020]; histone methyltransferase activity [GO:0042054]; lysine-acetylated histone binding [GO:0070577]; nuclear receptor coactivator activity [GO:0030374]; protein methyltransferase activity [GO:0008276]; protein-arginine N-methyltransferase activity [GO:0016274]; protein-arginine omega-N asymmetric methyltransferase activity [GO:0035242]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]; transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713],,CHEMBL5406;
PARP1,Q8IXQ6,Protein mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP9 (EC 2.4.2.-) (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like 9) (ARTD9) (B aggressive lymphoma protein) (Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 9) (PARP-9),BAL BAL1,"FUNCTION: ADP-ribosyltransferase which, in association with E3 ligase DTX3L, plays a role in DNA damage repair and in immune responses including interferon-mediated antiviral defenses (PubMed:16809771, PubMed:23230272, PubMed:26479788, PubMed:27796300). Within the complex, enhances DTX3L E3 ligase activity which is further enhanced by PARP9 binding to poly(ADP-ribose) (PubMed:28525742). In association with DTX3L and in presence of E1 and E2 enzymes, mediates NAD(+)-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin which prevents ubiquitin conjugation to substrates such as histones (PubMed:28525742). During DNA repair, PARP1 recruits PARP9/BAL1-DTX3L complex to DNA damage sites via PARP9 binding to ribosylated PARP1 (PubMed:23230272). Subsequent PARP1-dependent PARP9/BAL1-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272, PubMed:28525742). In response to DNA damage, PARP9-DTX3L complex is required for efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); the complex function is negatively modulated by PARP9 activity (PubMed:28525742). Dispensable for B-cell receptor (BCR) assembly through V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination (CSR) (By similarity). In macrophages, positively regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines production in response to IFNG stimulation by suppressing PARP14-mediated STAT1 ADP-ribosylation and thus promoting STAT1 phosphorylation (PubMed:27796300). Also suppresses PARP14-mediated STAT6 ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:27796300). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CAS9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16809771, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27796300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28525742}.",,,ADP-D-ribose binding [GO:0072570]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; enzyme inhibitor activity [GO:0004857]; histone binding [GO:0042393]; NAD+-protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:1990404]; NAD+-protein poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0003950]; NAD+-protein-C-terminal glycine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [GO:0140802]; nucleotidyltransferase activity [GO:0016779]; STAT family protein binding [GO:0097677]; transcription corepressor activity [GO:0003714]; ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding [GO:0044389],DISEASE: Note=Overexpressed at significantly higher levels in fatal high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLB-CL) compared to cured low-risk tumors.
