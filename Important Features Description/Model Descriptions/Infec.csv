CYP51A1,O43866,CD5 antigen-like (Apoptosis inhibitor expressed by macrophages) (hAIM) (CT-2) (IgM-associated peptide) (SP-alpha),API6,"FUNCTION: Secreted protein that acts as a key regulator of lipid synthesis: mainly expressed by macrophages in lymphoid and inflamed tissues and regulates mechanisms in inflammatory responses, such as infection or atherosclerosis. Able to inhibit lipid droplet size in adipocytes. Following incorporation into mature adipocytes via CD36-mediated endocytosis, associates with cytosolic FASN, inhibiting fatty acid synthase activity and leading to lipolysis, the degradation of triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). CD5L-induced lipolysis occurs with progression of obesity: participates in obesity-associated inflammation following recruitment of inflammatory macrophages into adipose tissues, a cause of insulin resistance and obesity-related metabolic disease. Regulation of intracellular lipids mediated by CD5L has a direct effect on transcription regulation mediated by nuclear receptors ROR-gamma (RORC). Acts as a key regulator of metabolic switch in T-helper Th17 cells. Regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Th17 cells by altering the lipid content and limiting synthesis of cholesterol ligand of RORC, the master transcription factor of Th17-cell differentiation. CD5L is mainly present in non-pathogenic Th17 cells, where it decreases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acyls (PUFA), affecting two metabolic proteins MSMO1 and CYP51A1, which synthesize ligands of RORC, limiting RORC activity and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Participates in obesity-associated autoimmunity via its association with IgM, interfering with the binding of IgM to Fcalpha/mu receptor and enhancing the development of long-lived plasma cells that produce high-affinity IgG autoantibodies (By similarity). Also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in macrophages: promotes macrophage survival from the apoptotic effects of oxidized lipids in case of atherosclerosis (PubMed:24295828). Involved in early response to microbial infection against various pathogens by acting as a pattern recognition receptor and by promoting autophagy (PubMed:16030018, PubMed:24223991, PubMed:24583716, PubMed:25713983). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QWK4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16030018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24223991, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24295828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24583716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25713983}.",,,serine-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004252],,

Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoclast proliferation and differentiation, the regulation of bone resorption, and is required for normal bone and tooth development. Required for normal male and female fertility, and for normal development of milk ducts and acinar structures in the mammary gland during pregnancy. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, regulates formation of membrane ruffles, cell adhesion and cell migration, and promotes cancer cell invasion. Activates several signaling pathways in response to ligand binding, including the ERK1/2 and the JNK pathway (PubMed:20504948, PubMed:30982609). Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG2, GRB2, SLA2 and CBL. Activation of PLCG2 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, that then lead to the activation of protein kinase C family members, especially PRKCD. Phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leads to activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Activated CSF1R also mediates activation of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, and of the SRC family kinases SRC, FYN and YES1. Activated CSF1R transmits signals both via proteins that directly interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain, or via adapter proteins, such as GRB2. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT3, STAT5A and/or STAT5B. Promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC1 and INPP5D/SHIP-1. Receptor signaling is down-regulated by protein phosphatases, such as INPP5D/SHIP-1, that dephosphorylate the receptor and its downstream effectors, and by rapid internalization of the activated receptor.

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated.

Also phosphorylates non-AMPK family proteins such as STRADA, PTEN and possibly p53/TP53. Acts as a key upstream regulator of AMPK by mediating phosphorylation and activation of AMPK catalytic subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and thereby regulates processes including: inhibition of signaling pathways that promote cell growth and proliferation when energy levels are low, glucose homeostasis in liver, activation of autophagy when cells undergo nutrient deprivation, and B-cell differentiation in the germinal center in response to DNA damage. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Required for cortical neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2, leading to axon initiation and specification. Involved in DNA damage response: interacts with p53/TP53 and recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation. Able to phosphorylate p53/TP53; the relevance of such result in vivo is however unclear and phosphorylation may be indirect and mediated by downstream STK11/LKB1 kinase NUAK1. Also acts as a mediator of p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis via interaction with p53/TP53: translocates to the mitochondrion during apoptosis and regulates p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis pathways. Regulates UV radiation-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A. In association with NUAK1, phosphorylates CDKN1A in response to UV radiation and contributes to its degradation which is necessary for optimal DNA repair (PubMed:25329316). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12805220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14517248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14976552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21317932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25329316}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Has a role in spermiogenesis. {ECO:0000250}.","ACT_SITE 176; /note=""Proton acceptor""",,3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004676]; AMP-activated protein kinase activity [GO:0004679]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; DNA-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004677]; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity [GO:0004694]; histone H2AS1 kinase activity [GO:0044024]; histone H2AS121 kinase activity [GO:0072371]; histone H2AT120 kinase activity [GO:1990244]; histone H2AXS139 kinase activity [GO:0035979]; histone H2BS14 kinase activity [GO:0044025]; histone H2BS36 kinase activity [GO:0140823]; histone H3S10 kinase activity [GO:0035175]; histone H3S28 kinase activity [GO:0044022]; histone H3S57 kinase activity [GO:0140855]; histone H3T11 kinase activity [GO:0035402]; histone H3T3 kinase activity [GO:0072354]; histone H3T45 kinase activity [GO:0140857]; histone H3T6 kinase activity [GO:0035403]; histone H4S1 kinase activity [GO:0044023]; LRR domain binding [GO:0030275]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; protein kinase activator activity [GO:0030295]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0072518]; ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity [GO:0004711],"DISEASE: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) [MIM:175200]: An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by melanocytic macules of the lips, multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and an increased risk for various neoplasms, including gastrointestinal cancer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10408777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21411391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9425897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9428765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9760200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9837816}.
