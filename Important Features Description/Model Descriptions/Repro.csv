Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. Binds via DLX1 to enhancers located in the intergenic region between DLX5 and DLX6 and this binding is stabilized by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Evf2 (By similarity). Binds to RNA in a promiscuous manner (By similarity). Binding to RNAs including lncRNA Evf2 leads to inhibition of SMARCA4 ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities (By similarity).

The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner (PubMed:29374058, PubMed:8804307). Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Has a strong influence on vitamin D-mediated transcriptional activity from an enhancer vitamin D receptor element (VDRE). May be a link between mammalian SWI-SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimer (PubMed:14698202).

GNRHR,O15516,Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) (EC 2.3.1.48) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHe8),BHLHE8 KIAA0334,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The CLOCK-BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region (PubMed:21980503). The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as important as its transcription activity in circadian control. Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner. Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and subsequent ureagenesis (PubMed:28985504). Drives the circadian rhythm of blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21980503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22284746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28985504}.",,,"chromatin DNA binding [GO:0031490]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001228]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; E-box binding [GO:0070888]; histone acetyltransferase activity [GO:0004402]; histone H2AK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043999]; histone H2AK9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044012]; histone H2BK12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044015]; histone H2BK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044014]; histone H3K122 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0140908]; histone H3K14 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0036408]; histone H3K18 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043993]; histone H3K23 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043994]; histone H3K27 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044017]; histone H3K36 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044018]; histone H3K4 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044016]; histone H3K56 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0032931]; histone H3K9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043992]; histone H4K12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043997]; histone H4K16 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0046972]; histone H4K5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043995]; histone H4K8 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043996]; protein dimerization activity [GO:0046983]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]",,

Plays a role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function; regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the regulation of antioxidant genes NFE2L2/NRF2 and its targets SESN2, PRDX3, CCLC and CCLM. Negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway; regulates the expression of MTOR and DEPTOR. Controls diurnal oscillations of Ly6C inflammatory monocytes; rhythmic recruitment of the PRC2 complex imparts diurnal variation to chemokine expression that is necessary to sustain Ly6C monocyte rhythms. Regulates the expression of HSD3B2, STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes involved in hair growth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions that take place prior to cell-cycle exit.

FSHR,P32121,Beta-arrestin-2 (Arrestin beta-2) (Non-visual arrestin-3),ARB2 ARR2,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity. Is involved in dopamine-stimulated AKT1 activity in the striatum by disrupting the association of AKT1 with its negative regulator PP2A. Involved in AGTR1-mediated chemotaxis. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in endocytosis of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 and down-regulates TGF-beta signaling such as NF-kappa-B activation. Involved in endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein receptor/LDLR. Involved in endocytosis of smoothened homolog/Smo, which also requires GRK2. Involved in endocytosis of SLC9A5. Involved in endocytosis of ENG and subsequent TGF-beta-mediated ERK activation and migration of epithelial cells. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN (PubMed:26839314). Involved in insulin resistance by acting as insulin-induced signaling scaffold for SRC, AKT1 and INSR. Involved in regulation of inhibitory signaling of natural killer cells by recruiting PTPN6 and PTPN11 to KIR2DL1. Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils.

Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) (PubMed:18001824, PubMed:18006705). Also controls the recruitment of UIMC1-BRCC3 (RAP80-BRCC36) and PAXIP1/PTIP to DNA damage sites (PubMed:18077395, PubMed:19202061). Promotes the recruitment of NBN to DNA damage sites by catalyzing 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of NBN (PubMed:23115235). Also recruited at DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) sites and catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, leading to recruitment of FAAP20/C1orf86 and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, followed by interstrand cross-link repair. H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Promotes the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interactions with the specific ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2N/UBC13 and ubiquitinates non-histone substrates such as PCNA. Substrates that are polyubiquitinated at 'Lys-63' are usually not targeted for degradation. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2L6/UBCH8, leading to degradation of substrate proteins such as CHEK2, JMJD2A/KDM4A and KU80/XRCC5: it is still unclear how the preference toward 'Lys-48'- versus 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination is regulated but it could be due to RNF8 ability to interact with specific E2 specific ligases. For instance, interaction with phosphorylated HERC2 promotes the association between RNF8 and UBE2N/UBC13 and favors the specific formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. Promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination and degradation the of KU80/XRCC5. Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of JMJD2A/KDM4A in collaboration with RNF168, leading to unmask H4K20me2 mark and promote the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites (PubMed:11322894, PubMed:14981089, PubMed:17724460, PubMed:18001825, PubMed:18337245, PubMed:18948756, PubMed:19015238, PubMed:19124460, PubMed:19203578, PubMed:19203579, PubMed:20550933, PubMed:21558560, PubMed:21857671, PubMed:21911360, PubMed:22266820, PubMed:22373579, PubMed:22531782, PubMed:22705371, PubMed:22980979). Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of POLD4/p12, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In the absence of POLD4, DNA polymerase delta complex exhibits higher proofreading activity (PubMed:23233665). In addition to its function in damage signaling, also plays a role in higher-order chromatin structure by mediating extensive chromatin decondensation. Involved in the activation of ATM by promoting histone H2B ubiquitination, which indirectly triggers histone H4 'Lys-16' acetylation (H4K16ac), establishing a chromatin environment that promotes efficient activation of ATM kinase. Required in the testis, where it plays a role in the replacement of histones during spermatogenesis. At uncapped telomeres, promotes the joining of deprotected chromosome ends by inducing H2A ubiquitination and TP53BP1 recruitment, suggesting that it may enhance cancer development by aggravating telomere-induced genome instability in case of telomeric crisis. Promotes the assembly of RAD51 at DNA DSBs in the absence of BRCA1 and TP53BP1 Also involved in class switch recombination in immune system, via its role in regulation of DSBs repair (PubMed:22865450).

Required for normal mesoderm patterning and correct axial organization during embryonic development, normal skeletogenesis and normal development of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2, GAB1 and SHB. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Promotes phosphorylation of SHC1, STAT1 and PTPN11/SHP2. In the nucleus, enhances RPS6KA1 and CREB1 activity and contributes to the regulation of transcription. FGFR1 signaling is down-regulated by IL17RD/SEF, and by FGFR1 ubiquitination, internalization and degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P16092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10830168, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11353842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12181353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1379697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1379698, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15117958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16597617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17311277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17623664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18480409, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19224897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19665973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20133753, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20139426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21765395, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622701, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663044}.","ACT_SITE 623; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19224897""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; boss receptor activity [GO:0008288]; brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor activity [GO:0060175]; epidermal growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005006]; fibroblast growth factor binding [GO:0017134]; fibroblast growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005007]; GPI-linked ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005004]; heparin binding [GO:0008201]; hepatocyte growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005008]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; insulin receptor activity [GO:0005009]; insulin-like growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005010]; macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor activity [GO:0005011]; placental growth factor receptor activity [GO:0036332]; platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor activity [GO:0005018]; platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor activity [GO:0005019]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; protein tyrosine kinase collagen receptor activity [GO:0038062]; receptor-receptor interaction [GO:0090722]; SH2 domain binding [GO:0042169]; stem cell factor receptor activity [GO:0005020]; transmembrane-ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005005]; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005021],"DISEASE: Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) [MIM:101600]: A syndrome characterized by the association of craniosynostosis, broad and deviated thumbs and big toes, and partial syndactyly of the fingers and toes.

NR1I2,Q49AN0,Cryptochrome-2,KIAA0658,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian transcriptional outputs. Less potent transcriptional repressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY1, though less effective in lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. Seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY1, dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. May mediate circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in CREB1 phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of the circadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of other processes. Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism modulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4.

Undergoes a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:16478993, PubMed:19696785). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:26991466, PubMed:27295069). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. They first alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385). Promotes cell differentiation by chaperoning BIRC2 and thereby protecting from auto-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal machinery (PubMed:18239673).
