NR3C1,P51532,Transcription activator BRG1 (EC 3.6.4.-) (ATP-dependent helicase SMARCA4) (BRG1-associated factor 190A) (BAF190A) (Mitotic growth and transcription activator) (Protein BRG-1) (Protein brahma homolog 1) (SNF2-beta) (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 4),BAF190A BRG1 SNF2B SNF2L4,"FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1.

NR3C1,O15516,Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) (EC 2.3.1.48) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHe8),BHLHE8 KIAA0334,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The CLOCK-BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region (PubMed:21980503). The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as important as its transcription activity in circadian control. Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner. Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and subsequent ureagenesis (PubMed:28985504). Drives the circadian rhythm of blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21980503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22284746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28985504}.",,,"chromatin DNA binding [GO:0031490]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001228]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; E-box binding [GO:0070888]; histone acetyltransferase activity [GO:0004402]; histone H2AK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043999]; histone H2AK9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044012]; histone H2BK12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044015]; histone H2BK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044014]; histone H3K122 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0140908]; histone H3K14 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0036408]; histone H3K18 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043993]; histone H3K23 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043994]; histone H3K27 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044017]; histone H3K36 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044018]; histone H3K4 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044016]; histone H3K56 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0032931]; histone H3K9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043992]; histone H4K12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043997]; histone H4K16 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0046972]; histone H4K5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043995]; histone H4K8 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043996]; protein dimerization activity [GO:0046983]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]",,

In addition to protein acetyltransferase, can use different acyl-CoA substrates, such as (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA), butanoyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA), 2-hydroxyisobutanoyl-CoA (2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA), lactoyl-CoA or propanoyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA), and is able to mediate protein crotonylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, lactylation or propionylation, respectively (PubMed:17267393, PubMed:25818647, PubMed:29775581, PubMed:31645732). Acts as a histone crotonyltransferase; crotonylation marks active promoters and enhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors (PubMed:25818647). Histone crotonyltransferase activity is dependent on the concentration of (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA) substrate and such activity is weak when (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA) concentration is low (PubMed:25818647). Also acts as a histone butyryltransferase; butyrylation marks active promoters (PubMed:17267393). Catalyzes histone lactylation in macrophages by using lactoyl-CoA directly derived from endogenous or exogenous lactate, leading to stimulates gene transcription (PubMed:31645732). Acts as a protein-lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyryltransferase; regulates glycolysis by mediating 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation of glycolytic enzymes (PubMed:29775581). Functions as a transcriptional coactivator for SMAD4 in the TGF-beta signaling pathway (PubMed:25514493). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B2RWS6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10733570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11511361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11701890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12586840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12929931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14752053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15448695, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15653507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15890677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16285960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16617102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16762839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17267393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17761950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18451878, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18722353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18782771, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18995842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20810990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21030595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21131905, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22084251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23415232, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23911289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23934153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24120661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25514493, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25818647, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26990986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29775581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30193097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30197302, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31645732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32561715, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37731000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8917528, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8945521, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20955178}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of HIV-1 infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat.

Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity which is essential for its chaperone activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:11274138, PubMed:12526792, PubMed:15577939, PubMed:15937123, PubMed:27353360, PubMed:29127155). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself (PubMed:29127155). Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:26991466, PubMed:27295069). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels (PubMed:25973397). In the first place, they alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues (PubMed:25973397). Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment (PubMed:25973397). Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397).

NR3C1,Q16526,Cryptochrome-1,PHLL1,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptional repressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effective in lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2 seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable of translocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteins to the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-BMAL1 independently of PER proteins and is found at CLOCK-BMAL1-bound sites, suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintain CLOCK-BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the proper time for transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and NAMPT (By similarity). May repress circadian target genes expression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2 through histone deacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of ATR and modulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver, mediates circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by binding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1 phosphorylation. Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing nuclear FOXO1 levels that down-regulates gluconeogenic gene expression (By similarity). Besides its role in the maintenance of the circadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of other processes. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism modulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4 (By similarity).

NR3C1,Q969G3,SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily E member 1 (BRG1-associated factor 57) (BAF57),BAF57,"FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF).

Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2.

Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane.

Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1. Required for VEGFA-mediated induction of NOS2 and NOS3, leading to the production of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells. Phosphorylates PLCG1.

Undergoes a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:16478993, PubMed:19696785). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:26991466, PubMed:27295069). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. They first alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385). Promotes cell differentiation by chaperoning BIRC2 and thereby protecting from auto-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal machinery (PubMed:18239673). Main chaperone involved in the phosphorylation/activation of the STAT1 by chaperoning both JAK2 and PRKCE under heat shock and in turn, activates its own transcription (PubMed:20353823). Involved in the translocation into ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment) of leaderless cargos (lacking the secretion signal sequence) such as the interleukin 1/IL-1; the translocation process is mediated by the cargo receptor TMED10 (PubMed:32272059). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16478993, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19696785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20353823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24613385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32272059, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25973397, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26991466, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27295069}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Binding to N.meningitidis NadA stimulates monocytes (PubMed:21949862).

Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Phosphorylates also exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. May regulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via the modulation of lamellipodia formation. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1-EPHA4 signaling. The complex p35/CDK5 participates in the regulation of the circadian clock by modulating the function of CLOCK protein: phosphorylates CLOCK at 'Thr-451' and 'Thr-461' and regulates the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in association with altered stability and subcellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12393264, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12691662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15992363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17009320, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17121855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17591690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17671990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18042622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19081376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19693690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20061803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20213743, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20826806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21209322, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21220307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21442427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21465480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21499257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24235147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822744}.","ACT_SITE 126; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004676]; acetylcholine receptor activator activity [GO:0030549]; AMP-activated protein kinase activity [GO:0004679]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004693]; DNA-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004677]; ErbB-2 class receptor binding [GO:0005176]; ErbB-3 class receptor binding [GO:0043125]; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity [GO:0004694]; histone H2AS1 kinase activity [GO:0044024]; histone H2AS121 kinase activity [GO:0072371]; histone H2AT120 kinase activity [GO:1990244]; histone H2AXS139 kinase activity [GO:0035979]; histone H2BS14 kinase activity [GO:0044025]; histone H2BS36 kinase activity [GO:0140823]; histone H3S10 kinase activity [GO:0035175]; histone H3S28 kinase activity [GO:0044022]; histone H3S57 kinase activity [GO:0140855]; histone H3T11 kinase activity [GO:0035402]; histone H3T3 kinase activity [GO:0072354]; histone H3T45 kinase activity [GO:0140857]; histone H3T6 kinase activity [GO:0035403]; histone H4S1 kinase activity [GO:0044023]; Hsp90 protein binding [GO:0051879]; kinase activity [GO:0016301]; p53 binding [GO:0002039]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0072518]; ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity [GO:0004711]; tau protein binding [GO:0048156]; tau-protein kinase activity [GO:0050321],"DISEASE: Lissencephaly 7, with cerebellar hypoplasia (LIS7) [MIM:616342]: A form of lissencephaly, a disorder of cortical development characterized by agyria or pachygyria and disorganization of the clear neuronal lamination of normal six-layered cortex.

N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity. This subunit contains the active site and the acceptor peptide and donor lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) binding pockets (By similarity). STT3B is present in a small subset of OST complexes and mediates both cotranslational and post-translational N-glycosylation of target proteins: STT3B-containing complexes are required for efficient post-translational glycosylation and while they are less competent than STT3A-containing complexes for cotranslational glycosylation, they have the ability to mediate glycosylation of some nascent sites that are not accessible for STT3A. STT3B-containing complexes also act post-translationally and mediate modification of skipped glycosylation sites in unfolded proteins. Plays a role in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway that mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins by mediating N-glycosylation of unfolded proteins, which are then recognized by the ERAD pathway and targeted for degradation. Mediates glycosylation of the disease variant AMYL-TTR 'Asp-38' of TTR at 'Asn-118', leading to its degradation (PubMed:19167329, PubMed:22607976). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P39007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19167329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22607976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31831667}.",,PATHWAY: Protein modification; protein glycosylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31831667}.,dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase activity [GO:0004579]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872],"DISEASE: Congenital disorder of glycosylation 1X (CDG1X) [MIM:615597]: A form of congenital disorder of glycosylation, a multisystem disorder caused by a defect in glycoprotein biosynthesis and characterized by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins.
