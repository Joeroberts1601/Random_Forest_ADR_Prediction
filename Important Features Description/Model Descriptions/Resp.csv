Possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity and utilizes ATP to gate its channel; the passive flow of anions through the channel is gated by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the ATP-binding domains (PubMed:11524016, PubMed:15284228, PubMed:26627831, PubMed:8910473). The ion channel is also permeable to HCO(3)(-); selectivity depends on the extracellular chloride concentration (PubMed:15010471, PubMed:19019741). In vitro, mediates ATP-dependent glutathione flux (PubMed:12727866).

Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JLN9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12087098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14651849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15268862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15467718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15545625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15718470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17517883, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18372248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18497260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18762023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20516213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20537536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21376236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22343943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22576015, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22692423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23426360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23524951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24403073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24448649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24670654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25438055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25799227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26018084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26584640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29150432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29236692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29424687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29567957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30704899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31112131, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31601708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31695197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32561715, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32612235, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34289345, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34519269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35926713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36608670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36691768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36697823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37751742}.",,,3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004676]; AMP-activated protein kinase activity [GO:0004679]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; DNA-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004677]; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity [GO:0004694]; histone H2AS1 kinase activity [GO:0044024]; histone H2AS121 kinase activity [GO:0072371]; histone H2AT120 kinase activity [GO:1990244]; histone H2AXS139 kinase activity [GO:0035979]; histone H2BS14 kinase activity [GO:0044025]; histone H2BS36 kinase activity [GO:0140823]; histone H3S10 kinase activity [GO:0035175]; histone H3S28 kinase activity [GO:0044022]; histone H3S57 kinase activity [GO:0140855]; histone H3T11 kinase activity [GO:0035402]; histone H3T3 kinase activity [GO:0072354]; histone H3T45 kinase activity [GO:0140857]; histone H3T6 kinase activity [GO:0035403]; histone H4S1 kinase activity [GO:0044023]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; inositol hexakisphosphate binding [GO:0000822]; phosphoprotein binding [GO:0051219]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0072518]; ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity [GO:0004711]; ribosome binding [GO:0043022]; RNA polymerase III type 1 promoter sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0001002]; RNA polymerase III type 2 promoter sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0001003]; RNA polymerase III type 3 promoter sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0001006]; TFIIIC-class transcription factor complex binding [GO:0001156],"DISEASE: Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (SKS) [MIM:616638]: An autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly, seizures, umbilical hernia, and facial dysmorphic features. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25851998, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26542245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27830187}.

Within the mTORC1 complex, RPTOR acts both as a molecular adapter, which (1) mediates recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes via interaction with small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD), and a (2) substrate-specific adapter, which promotes substrate specificity by binding to TOS motif-containing proteins and direct them towards the active site of the MTOR kinase domain for phosphorylation (PubMed:12747827, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:26588989, PubMed:37541260). mTORC1 complex regulates many cellular processes, such as odontoblast and osteoclast differentiation or neuronal transmission (By similarity). mTORC1 complex in excitatory neuronal transmission is required for the prosocial behavior induced by the psychoactive substance lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K4Q0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12747827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24403073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26588989, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32561715, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37541260}.",,,14-3-3 protein binding [GO:0071889]; enzyme-substrate adaptor activity [GO:0140767]; protein kinase activator activity [GO:0030295]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity [GO:0030291]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; protein-macromolecule adaptor activity [GO:0030674]; small GTPase binding [GO:0031267],,CHEMBL3120040;

In response to nutrients, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating several substrates, such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2) and EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1) (PubMed:12718876, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24403073). In the same time, it inhibits catabolic pathways by phosphorylating the autophagy initiation components ULK1 and ATG13, as well as transcription factor TFEB, a master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (PubMed:24403073). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:24403073). Within mTORC1, MLST8 interacts directly with MTOR and enhances its kinase activity (PubMed:12718876). In nutrient-poor conditions, stabilizes the MTOR-RPTOR interaction and favors RPTOR-mediated inhibition of MTOR activity (PubMed:12718876). As part of the mTORC2 complex, transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15467718, PubMed:35926713). mTORC2 is also activated by growth factors, but seems to be nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15467718, PubMed:35926713). mTORC2 functions upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, probably by activating one or more Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 promotes the serum-induced formation of stress-fibers or F-actin (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 also modulates the phosphorylation of PRKCA on 'Ser-657' (PubMed:15467718).

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:28178239). Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR and RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:15899889, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function (By similarity). Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex (PubMed:17936702). The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function (PubMed:17936702). Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1 (PubMed:18952604). In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B (PubMed:17052453). May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin (By similarity). Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:23429703). Following activation by mTORC1, phosphorylates EPRS and thereby plays a key role in fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and also most probably in interferon-gamma-induced translation inhibition (PubMed:28178239). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P67999, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8BSK8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11500364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12801526, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14673156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15071500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15341740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15899889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17052453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17053147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17936702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18952604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19085255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19720745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19935711, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19995915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22017876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28178239}.","ACT_SITE 218; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004676]; AMP-activated protein kinase activity [GO:0004679]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; DNA-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004677]; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity [GO:0004694]; histone H2AS1 kinase activity [GO:0044024]; histone H2AS121 kinase activity [GO:0072371]; histone H2AT120 kinase activity [GO:1990244]; histone H2AXS139 kinase activity [GO:0035979]; histone H2BS14 kinase activity [GO:0044025]; histone H2BS36 kinase activity [GO:0140823]; histone H3S10 kinase activity [GO:0035175]; histone H3S28 kinase activity [GO:0044022]; histone H3S57 kinase activity [GO:0140855]; histone H3T11 kinase activity [GO:0035402]; histone H3T3 kinase activity [GO:0072354]; histone H3T45 kinase activity [GO:0140857]; histone H3T6 kinase activity [GO:0035403]; histone H4S1 kinase activity [GO:0044023]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; PDZ domain binding [GO:0030165]; peptide binding [GO:0042277]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein phosphatase 2A binding [GO:0051721]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0072518]; ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity [GO:0004711],,CHEMBL4501;

MTOR,P31749,RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) (Protein kinase B) (PKB) (Protein kinase B alpha) (PKB alpha) (Proto-oncogene c-Akt) (RAC-PK-alpha),PKB RAC,"FUNCTION: AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:15861136, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:31204173). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12172553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15861136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30504268, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31204173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31548394, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.","ACT_SITE 274; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,"14-3-3 protein binding [GO:0071889]; 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004676]; AMP-activated protein kinase activity [GO:0004679]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; DNA-dependent protein kinase activity [GO:0004677]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity [GO:0004694]; histone H2AS1 kinase activity [GO:0044024]; histone H2AS121 kinase activity [GO:0072371]; histone H2AT120 kinase activity [GO:1990244]; histone H2AXS139 kinase activity [GO:0035979]; histone H2BS14 kinase activity [GO:0044025]; histone H2BS36 kinase activity [GO:0140823]; histone H3S10 kinase activity [GO:0035175]; histone H3S28 kinase activity [GO:0044022]; histone H3S57 kinase activity [GO:0140855]; histone H3T11 kinase activity [GO:0035402]; histone H3T3 kinase activity [GO:0072354]; histone H3T45 kinase activity [GO:0140857]; histone H3T6 kinase activity [GO:0035403]; histone H4S1 kinase activity [GO:0044023]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; kinase activity [GO:0016301]; nitric-oxide synthase regulator activity [GO:0030235]; phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate binding [GO:0005547]; phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate binding [GO:0043325]; potassium channel activator activity [GO:0099104]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity [GO:0030291]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; Rho-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0072518]; ribosomal protein S6 kinase activity [GO:0004711]","DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

GDNF ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, PSPN and GDF15) first bind their corresponding GDNFR coreceptors (GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, GFRA4 and GFRAL, respectively), triggering RET autophosphorylation and activation, leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK- and AKT-signaling pathways (PubMed:21994944, PubMed:23333276, PubMed:24560924, PubMed:25242331, PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886). Acts as a dependence receptor via the GDNF-GFRA1 signaling: in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs within pituitary, promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF (PubMed:20616503, PubMed:21994944).

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated. Thus, although it can enter the nucleus and associate with the nuclear envelope, it cannot incorporate normally into the nuclear lamina (PubMed:12714972). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12714972}.; DISEASE: Cardiomyopathy, dilated, with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (CMDHH) [MIM:212112]: A disorder characterized by the association of genital anomalies, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Also phosphorylates non-AMPK family proteins such as STRADA, PTEN and possibly p53/TP53. Acts as a key upstream regulator of AMPK by mediating phosphorylation and activation of AMPK catalytic subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and thereby regulates processes including: inhibition of signaling pathways that promote cell growth and proliferation when energy levels are low, glucose homeostasis in liver, activation of autophagy when cells undergo nutrient deprivation, and B-cell differentiation in the germinal center in response to DNA damage. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Required for cortical neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2, leading to axon initiation and specification. Involved in DNA damage response: interacts with p53/TP53 and recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation. Able to phosphorylate p53/TP53; the relevance of such result in vivo is however unclear and phosphorylation may be indirect and mediated by downstream STK11/LKB1 kinase NUAK1. Also acts as a mediator of p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis via interaction with p53/TP53: translocates to the mitochondrion during apoptosis and regulates p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis pathways. Regulates UV radiation-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A.
