GNRHR,O15516,Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) (EC 2.3.1.48) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHe8),BHLHE8 KIAA0334,"FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The CLOCK-BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region (PubMed:21980503). The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as important as its transcription activity in circadian control. Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner. Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and subsequent ureagenesis (PubMed:28985504). Drives the circadian rhythm of blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14645221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21980503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22284746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23785138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28985504}.",,,"chromatin DNA binding [GO:0031490]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001228]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; E-box binding [GO:0070888]; histone acetyltransferase activity [GO:0004402]; histone H2AK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043999]; histone H2AK9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044012]; histone H2BK12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044015]; histone H2BK5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044014]; histone H3K122 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0140908]; histone H3K14 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0036408]; histone H3K18 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043993]; histone H3K23 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043994]; histone H3K27 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044017]; histone H3K36 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044018]; histone H3K4 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0044016]; histone H3K56 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0032931]; histone H3K9 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043992]; histone H4K12 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043997]; histone H4K16 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0046972]; histone H4K5 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043995]; histone H4K8 acetyltransferase activity [GO:0043996]; protein dimerization activity [GO:0046983]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]",,

Regulates the expression of HSD3B2, STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes involved in hair growth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions that take place prior to cell-cycle exit. Regulates the circadian expression of CIART and KLF11.

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34239127, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19754430}.",,,protein tag activity [GO:0031386]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625],,CHEMBL4523178;

Endocytosed in target cells via its receptor PLXNB2 and translocates to the cytoplasm or nucleus (PubMed:29100074, PubMed:32510170). Under stress conditions, localizes to the cytoplasm and promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs): specifically cleaves a subset of tRNAs within anticodon loops to produce tRNA-derived stress-induced fragments (tiRNAs), resulting in translation repression and inhibition of cell proliferation (PubMed:1400510, PubMed:19332886, PubMed:20129916, PubMed:21855800, PubMed:23047679, PubMed:27518564, PubMed:29100074, PubMed:29748193, PubMed:32510170, PubMed:38718836). tiRNas also prevent formation of apoptosome, thereby promoting cell survival (By similarity). Preferentially cleaves RNAs between a pyrimidine and an adenosine residue, suggesting that it cleaves the anticodon loop of tRNA(Ala) (32-UUAGCAU-38) after positions 33 and 36 (PubMed:3289612, PubMed:38718836). Cleaves a subset of tRNAs, including tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Glu), tRNA(Gly), tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Val), tRNA(His), tRNA(Asp) and tRNA(Sec) (PubMed:31582561). Under growth conditions and in differentiated cells, translocates to the nucleus and stimulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, including that containing the initiation site sequences of 45S rRNA, thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:12051708, PubMed:15735021, PubMed:27518564, PubMed:29100074, PubMed:8127865).
