CASP7,P55210,Caspase-7 (CASP-7) (EC 3.4.22.60) (Apoptotic protease Mch-3) (CMH-1) (ICE-like apoptotic protease 3) (ICE-LAP3) [Cleaved into: Caspase-7 subunit p20; Caspase-7 subunit p11],MCH3,"FUNCTION: Thiol protease involved in different programmed cell death processes, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis or granzyme-mediated programmed cell death, by proteolytically cleaving target proteins (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:11701129, PubMed:15314233, PubMed:16916640, PubMed:17646170, PubMed:18723680, PubMed:19581639, PubMed:8521391, PubMed:8567622, PubMed:8576161, PubMed:9070923). Has a marked preference for Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) consensus sequences, with some plasticity for alternate non-canonical sequences (PubMed:12824163, PubMed:15314233, PubMed:17697120, PubMed:19581639, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:23650375, PubMed:23897474, PubMed:27032039). Its involvement in the different programmed cell death processes is probably determined by upstream proteases that activate CASP7 (By similarity). Acts as an effector caspase involved in the execution phase of apoptosis: following cleavage and activation by initiator caspases (CASP8, CASP9 and/or CASP10), mediates execution of apoptosis by catalyzing cleavage of proteins, such as CLSPN, PARP1, PTGES3 and YY1 (PubMed:10497198, PubMed:16123041, PubMed:16374543, PubMed:16916640, PubMed:18723680, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:21555521, PubMed:22184066, PubMed:22451931, PubMed:27889207, PubMed:28863261, PubMed:31586028, PubMed:34156061, PubMed:35338844, PubMed:35446120). Compared to CASP3, acts as a minor executioner caspase and cleaves a limited set of target proteins (PubMed:18723680). Acts as a key regulator of the inflammatory response in response to bacterial infection by catalyzing cleavage and activation of the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase SMPD1 in the extracellular milieu, thereby promoting membrane repair (PubMed:21157428). Regulates pyroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells: cleaved and activated by CASP1 in response to S.typhimurium infection, promoting its secretion to the extracellular milieu, where it catalyzes activation of SMPD1, generating ceramides that repair membranes and counteract the action of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores (By similarity). Regulates granzyme-mediated programmed cell death in hepatocytes: cleaved and activated by granzyme B (GZMB) in response to bacterial infection, promoting its secretion to the extracellular milieu, where it catalyzes activation of SMPD1, generating ceramides that repair membranes and counteract the action of perforin (PRF1) pores (By similarity). Following cleavage by CASP1 in response to inflammasome activation, catalyzes processing and inactivation of PARP1, alleviating the transcription repressor activity of PARP1 (PubMed:22464733). Acts as an inhibitor of type I interferon production during virus-induced apoptosis by mediating cleavage of antiviral proteins CGAS, IRF3 and MAVS, thereby preventing cytokine overproduction (By similarity). Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) (PubMed:8643593). Cleaves phospholipid scramblase proteins XKR4, XKR8 and XKR9 (By similarity). In case of infection, catalyzes cleavage of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein ORF57, thereby preventing expression of viral lytic genes (PubMed:20159985). Cleaves BIRC6 following inhibition of BIRC6-caspase binding by DIABLO/SMAC (PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758106). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97864, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10497198, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11701129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12824163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15314233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16123041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16374543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17646170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17697120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18723680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19581639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20159985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20566630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21157428, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21555521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22184066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22451931, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22464733, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23650375, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23897474, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27032039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27889207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28863261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31586028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34156061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35338844, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35446120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36758104, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36758106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8521391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8567622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8576161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8643593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9070923}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform Beta]: Lacks enzymatic activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8521391}.","ACT_SITE 144; /evidence=""ECO:0000269|PubMed:15314233""; ACT_SITE 186; /evidence=""ECO:0000269|PubMed:11701129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15314233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916640""",,aspartic-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004190]; cysteine-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004197]; cysteine-type peptidase activity [GO:0008234]; peptidase activity [GO:0008233]; RNA binding [GO:0003723],,CHEMBL3468;
CASP7,P98170,E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase XIAP (EC 2.3.2.27) (Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 4) (IAP-like protein) (ILP) (hILP) (Inhibitor of apoptosis protein 3) (IAP-3) (hIAP-3) (hIAP3) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase XIAP) (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) (X-linked IAP),API3 BIRC4 IAP3,"FUNCTION: Multi-functional protein which regulates not only caspases and apoptosis, but also modulates inflammatory signaling and immunity, copper homeostasis, mitogenic kinase signaling, cell proliferation, as well as cell invasion and metastasis (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:11447297, PubMed:12121969, PubMed:12620238, PubMed:17560374, PubMed:17967870, PubMed:19473982, PubMed:20154138, PubMed:22103349, PubMed:9230442). Acts as a direct caspase inhibitor (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:12620238). Directly bind to the active site pocket of CASP3 and CASP7 and obstructs substrate entry (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:16352606, PubMed:16916640). Inactivates CASP9 by keeping it in a monomeric, inactive state (PubMed:12620238). Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating NF-kappa-B signaling and the target proteins for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity include: RIPK1, RIPK2, MAP3K2/MEKK2, DIABLO/SMAC, AIFM1, CCS, PTEN and BIRC5/survivin (PubMed:17560374, PubMed:17967870, PubMed:19473982, PubMed:20154138, PubMed:22103349, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Acts as an important regulator of innate immunity by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, thereby transforming RIPK2 into a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors, ultimately leading to activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (PubMed:19667203, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 also promotes recruitment of the LUBAC complex to RIPK2 (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636). Regulates the BMP signaling pathway and the SMAD and MAP3K7/TAK1 dependent pathways leading to NF-kappa-B and JNK activation (PubMed:17560374). Ubiquitination of CCS leads to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its physiologic target, SOD1, rather than proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20154138). Ubiquitination of MAP3K2/MEKK2 and AIFM1 does not lead to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17967870, PubMed:22103349). Plays a role in copper homeostasis by ubiquitinating COMMD1 and promoting its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:14685266). Can also function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation (PubMed:21145488). Ubiquitinates and therefore mediates the proteasomal degradation of BCL2 in response to apoptosis (PubMed:29020630). Protects cells from spontaneous formation of the ripoptosome, a large multi-protein complex that has the capability to kill cancer cells in a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manner (PubMed:22095281). Suppresses ripoptosome formation by ubiquitinating RIPK1 and CASP8 (PubMed:22095281). Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling and ubiquitinates TLE1, TLE2, TLE3, TLE4 and AES (PubMed:22304967). Ubiquitination of TLE3 results in inhibition of its interaction with TCF7L2/TCF4 thereby allowing efficient recruitment and binding of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin to TCF7L2/TCF4 that is required to initiate a Wnt-specific transcriptional program (PubMed:22304967). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12620238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14685266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16352606, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17967870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19473982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667203, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21145488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22103349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22304967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22607974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29020630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29452636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30026309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9230442, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22095281}.",,,cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004869]; cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity involved in apoptotic process [GO:0043027]; endopeptidase regulator activity [GO:0061135]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; protein serine/threonine kinase binding [GO:0120283]; ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]; ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842],"DISEASE: Lymphoproliferative syndrome, X-linked, 2 (XLP2) [MIM:300635]: A rare immunodeficiency characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

CASP7,P11021,Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (EC 3.6.4.10) (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein) (GRP-78) (Binding-immunoglobulin protein) (BiP) (Heat shock protein 70 family protein 5) (HSP70 family protein 5) (Heat shock protein family A member 5) (Immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein),GRP78,"FUNCTION: Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that plays a key role in protein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (PubMed:2294010, PubMed:23769672, PubMed:23990668, PubMed:28332555). Involved in the correct folding of proteins and degradation of misfolded proteins via its interaction with DNAJC10/ERdj5, probably to facilitate the release of DNAJC10/ERdj5 from its substrate (By similarity). Acts as a key repressor of the EIF2AK3/PERK and ERN1/IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) (PubMed:1550958, PubMed:11907036, PubMed:19538957). In the unstressed endoplasmic reticulum, recruited by DNAJB9/ERdj4 to the luminal region of ERN1/IRE1, leading to disrupt the dimerization of ERN1/IRE1, thereby inactivating ERN1/IRE1 (By similarity). Also binds and inactivates EIF2AK3/PERK in unstressed cells (PubMed:11907036). Accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum causes release of HSPA5/BiP from ERN1/IRE1 and EIF2AK3/PERK, allowing their homodimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:11907036). Plays an auxiliary role in post-translational transport of small presecretory proteins across endoplasmic reticulum (ER). May function as an allosteric modulator for SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex, likely cooperating with SEC62 to enable the productive insertion of these precursors into SEC61 channel. Appears to specifically regulate translocation of precursors having inhibitory residues in their mature region that weaken channel gating. May also play a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation (PubMed:26045166). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G3I8R9, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20029, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11907036, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1550958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19538957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2294010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23769672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26045166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28332555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29719251}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Plays an important role in viral binding to the host cell membrane and entry for several flaviruses such as Dengue virus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (PubMed:15098107, PubMed:28053106, PubMed:33432092).

Acts as a downstream effector of the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 (PubMed:7744004). Activation by the binding of active CDC42 and RAC1 results in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues (PubMed:7744004). Full-length PAK2 stimulates cell survival and cell growth (PubMed:7744004). Phosphorylates MAPK4 and MAPK6 and activates the downstream target MAPKAPK5, a regulator of F-actin polymerization and cell migration (PubMed:21317288). Phosphorylates JUN and plays an important role in EGF-induced cell proliferation (PubMed:21177766). Phosphorylates many other substrates including histone H4 to promote assembly of H3.3 and H4 into nucleosomes, BAD, ribosomal protein S6, or MBP (PubMed:21724829). Phosphorylates CASP7, thereby preventing its activity (PubMed:21555521, PubMed:27889207). Additionally, associates with ARHGEF7 and GIT1 to perform kinase-independent functions such as spindle orientation control during mitosis (PubMed:19273597, PubMed:19923322). On the other hand, apoptotic stimuli such as DNA damage lead to caspase-mediated cleavage of PAK2, generating PAK-2p34, an active p34 fragment that translocates to the nucleus and promotes cellular apoptosis involving the JNK signaling pathway (PubMed:12853446, PubMed:16617111, PubMed:9171063).

CASP7,Q9NR09,Dual E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase BIRC6 (EC 2.3.2.24) (BIR repeat-containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) (BRUCE) (Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6) (Ubiquitin-conjugating BIR domain enzyme apollon) (APOLLON),KIAA1289,"FUNCTION: Anti-apoptotic protein known as inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) which can regulate cell death by controlling caspases and by acting as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PubMed:14765125, PubMed:15200957, PubMed:18329369). Unlike most IAPs, does not contain a RING domain and it is not a RING-type E3 ligase (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Instead acts as a dual E2/E3 enzyme that combines ubiquitin conjugating (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3) activities in a single polypeptide (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitination is mediated by a non-canonical E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme UBA6 (PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitinates CASP3, CASP7 and CASP9 and inhibits their caspase activity; also ubiquitinates their procaspases but to a weaker extent (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitinates pro-apoptotic factors DIABLO/SMAC and HTRA2 (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106).

PARP1 initiates the repair of DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones (H2BS6ADPr and H3S10ADPr), thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:17177976, PubMed:18172500, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:19661379, PubMed:23230272, PubMed:27067600, PubMed:34465625, PubMed:34874266). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP1 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:33683197, PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). In addition to base excision repair (BER) pathway, also involved in double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair: together with TIMELESS, accumulates at DNA damage sites and promotes homologous recombination repair by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:26344098, PubMed:30356214). Mediates the poly-ADP-ribosylation of a number of proteins, including itself, APLF, CHFR, RPA1 and NFAT5 (PubMed:17396150, PubMed:19764761, PubMed:24906880, PubMed:34049076). In addition to proteins, also able to ADP-ribosylate DNA: catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of DNA strand break termini containing terminal phosphates and a 2'-OH group in single- and double-stranded DNA, respectively (PubMed:27471034). Required for PARP9 and DTX3L recruitment to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (PubMed:23230272). PARP1-mediated DNA repair in neurons plays a role in sleep: senses DNA damage in neurons and promotes sleep, facilitating efficient DNA repair (By similarity). In addition to DNA repair, also involved in other processes, such as transcription regulation, programmed cell death, membrane repair, adipogenesis and innate immunity (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:17177976, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:27256882, PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35124853, PubMed:35393539, PubMed:35460603). Acts as a repressor of transcription: binds to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure in a manner similar to histone H1, thereby altering RNA polymerase II (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:22464733). Acts both as a positive and negative regulator of transcription elongation, depending on the context (PubMed:27256882, PubMed:35393539). Acts as a positive regulator of transcription elongation by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of NELFE, preventing RNA-binding activity of NELFE and relieving transcription pausing (PubMed:27256882). Acts as a negative regulator of transcription elongation in response to DNA damage by catalyzing poly-ADP-ribosylation of CCNT1, disrupting the phase separation activity of CCNT1 and subsequent activation of CDK9 (PubMed:35393539). Involved in replication fork progression following interaction with CARM1: mediates poly-ADP-ribosylation at replication forks, slowing fork progression (PubMed:33412112). Poly-ADP-ribose chains generated by PARP1 also play a role in poly-ADP-ribose-dependent cell death, a process named parthanatos (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:32315358, PubMed:32844745, PubMed:35460603). Acts by mediating poly-ADP-ribosylation of CGAS: PARP1 translocates into the cytosol following phosphorylation by PRKDC and catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of CGAS (PubMed:35460603). Acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis: catalyzes poly-ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B on 'Glu-35' (H2BE35ADPr) following interaction with NMNAT1, inhibiting phosphorylation of H2B at 'Ser-36' (H2BS36ph), thereby blocking expression of pro-adipogenetic genes (By similarity). Involved in the synthesis of ATP in the nucleus, together with NMNAT1, PARG and NUDT5 (PubMed:27257257). Nuclear ATP generation is required for extensive chromatin remodeling events that are energy-consuming (PubMed:27257257). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P11103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15607977, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17177976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17396150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18055453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18172500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19344625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19661379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19764761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20388712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21680843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22464733, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22582261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23230272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25043379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26344098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26626479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26626480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27067600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27256882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27257257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27471034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28190768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29954836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30104678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30257210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30356214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31796734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32028527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32241924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32315358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32358582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32844745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33186521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33412112, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33589610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33683197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34049076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34465625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34625544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34732825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34737271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34795260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34874266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35124853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35393539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35460603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7852410, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9315851}.; FUNCTION: [Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1, processed C-terminus]: Promotes AIFM1-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:33168626).

In normal conditions, ubiquitinated and degraded in the cytoplasm by the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:11035812, PubMed:15601839, PubMed:29018201). In response to oxidative stress, electrophile metabolites inhibit activity of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2, heterodimerization with one of the small Maf proteins and binding to ARE elements of cytoprotective target genes (PubMed:19489739, PubMed:29590092). The NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway is also activated in response to selective autophagy: autophagy promotes interaction between KEAP1 and SQSTM1/p62 and subsequent inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972). The NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway is also activated during the unfolded protein response (UPR), contributing to redox homeostasis and cell survival following endoplasmic reticulum stress (By similarity). May also be involved in the transcriptional activation of genes of the beta-globin cluster by mediating enhancer activity of hypersensitive site 2 of the beta-globin locus control region (PubMed:7937919). Also plays an important role in the regulation of the innate immune response and antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing. It is a critical regulator of the innate immune response and survival during sepsis by maintaining redox homeostasis and restraint of the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways like MyD88-dependent and -independent and TNF-alpha signaling (By similarity). Suppresses macrophage inflammatory response by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and the induction of IL6 (By similarity). Binds to the proximity of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and inhibits RNA Pol II recruitment. The inhibition is independent of the NRF2-binding motif and reactive oxygen species level (By similarity). Represses antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing by suppressing the expression of the adapter protein STING1 and decreasing responsiveness to STING1 agonists while increasing susceptibility to infection with DNA viruses (PubMed:30158636). Once activated, limits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection and to virus-derived ligands through a mechanism that involves inhibition of IRF3 dimerization. Also inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 replication, as well as the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism (PubMed:33009401). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11035812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15601839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19489739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29018201, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29590092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30158636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31398338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33009401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7937919}.",,,"DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0001228]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; molecular condensate scaffold activity [GO:0140693]; protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0061629]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]; transcription coregulator binding [GO:0001221]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]","DISEASE: Immunodeficiency, developmental delay, and hypohomocysteinemia (IMDDHH) [MIM:617744]: An early onset multisystem disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, developmental delay, poor growth, intellectual disability, and hypohomocysteinemia.

Key effector of the integrated stress response (ISR) to unfolded proteins: EIF2AK3/PERK specifically recognizes and binds misfolded proteins, leading to its activation and EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation (PubMed:10677345, PubMed:27917829, PubMed:31023583). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activators ATF4 and QRICH1, and hence allowing ATF4- and QRICH1-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:10026192, PubMed:10677345, PubMed:31023583, PubMed:33384352). The EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response increases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by promoting ATF4-mediated expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1, thereby increasing formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (PubMed:31023583). In contrast to most subcellular compartments, mitochondria are protected from the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response due to EIF2AK3/PERK inhibition by ATAD3A at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites (PubMed:39116259). In addition to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha, also phosphorylates NFE2L2/NRF2 in response to stress, promoting release of NFE2L2/NRF2 from the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to nuclear accumulation and activation of NFE2L2/NRF2 (By similarity).

Upon activation by neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), promotes the activation of phagocytosis in macrophages as well as the shift in cytokine release toward an anti-inflammatory profile, and thus helps to reverse inflammatory pain. In addition, the increased macrophage phagocytosis mediates protection against sepsis upon pathogen infection. Additionally, extracellular vesicles derived from efferocyte express prosaposin, which binds to macrophage GPR37 to increase expression of the efferocytosis receptor TIM4 via an ERK-AP1-dependent signaling axis, leading to increased macrophage efferocytosis efficiency and accelerated resolution of inflammation (By similarity). May also act as a maturation factor of LRP6, protecting LRP6 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and thereby promoting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (PubMed:28341812). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QY42, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11439185, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23690594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25977097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28341812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9526070}.",,,G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity [GO:0008528]; G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; heat shock protein binding [GO:0031072]; Hsp70 protein binding [GO:0030544]; neuropeptide binding [GO:0042923]; neuropeptide receptor activity [GO:0008188]; PDZ domain binding [GO:0030165]; peptide binding [GO:0042277]; prosaposin receptor activity [GO:0036505]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625],,CHEMBL4523862;

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity).

The antiviral activity can involve one or several isoform(s) and can be enhanced by the permanent PML-NB-associated protein DAXX or by the recruitment of p53/TP53 within these structures. Isoform PML-4 restricts varicella zoster virus (VZV) via sequestration of virion capsids in PML-NBs thereby preventing their nuclear egress and inhibiting formation of infectious virus particles. The sumoylated isoform PML-4 restricts rabies virus by inhibiting viral mRNA and protein synthesis. The cytoplasmic isoform PML-14 can restrict herpes simplex virus-1 (HHV-1) replication by sequestering the viral E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ICP0 in the cytoplasm.

MAPK1,Q02750,Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP kinase kinase 1) (MAPKK 1) (MKK1) (EC 2.7.12.2) (ERK activator kinase 1) (MAPK/ERK kinase 1) (MEK 1),MEK1 PRKMK1,"FUNCTION: Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis. MAP2K1/MEK1 has been shown to export PPARG from the nucleus. The MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC), as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14737111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29433126}.","ACT_SITE 190; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; JUN kinase kinase activity [GO:0008545]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; MAP-kinase scaffold activity [GO:0005078]; protein kinase activator activity [GO:0030295]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; scaffold protein binding [GO:0097110],"DISEASE: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 3 (CFC3) [MIM:615279]: A form of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects and intellectual disability.
