The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repressBMAL1 transcription, respectively.BMAL1 positively regulates myogenesis and negatively regulates adipogenesis via the transcriptional control of the genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Plays a role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function; regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the regulation of antioxidant genes NFE2L2/NRF2 and its targets SESN2, PRDX3, CCLC and CCLM. Negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway; regulates the expression of MTOR and DEPTOR. Controls diurnal oscillations of Ly6C inflammatory monocytes; rhythmic recruitment of the PRC2 complex imparts diurnal variation to chemokine expression that is necessary to sustain Ly6C monocyte rhythms. Regulates the expression of HSD3B2, STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes involved in hair growth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions that take place prior to cell-cycle exit. Regulates the circadian expression of CIART and KLF11. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimer positively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and LDHA and modulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity by regulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1 (ADCY1) in the retina. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (PubMed:23229515). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3' (PubMed:23229515). Essential for the rhythmic interaction of CLOCK with ASS1 and plays a critical role in positively regulating CLOCK-mediated acetylation of ASS1 (PubMed:28985504). Plays a role in protecting against lethal sepsis by limiting the expression of immune checkpoint protein CD274 in macrophages in a PKM2-dependent manner (By similarity).

Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase the transcriptional activity of p53/TP53 through acetylation and subsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function (PubMed:18722353). Following DNA damage, forms a stress-responsive p53/TP53 coactivator complex with JMY which mediates p53/TP53 acetylation, thereby increasing p53/TP53-dependent transcription and apoptosis (PubMed:11511361, PubMed:15448695). Promotes chromatin acetylation in heat shock responsive HSP genes during the heat shock response (HSR), thereby stimulating HSR transcription (PubMed:18451878).

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity). Phosphorylates phosphoglycerate kinase PGK1 under hypoxic conditions to promote its targeting to the mitochondrion and suppress the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate (PubMed:26942675). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10617468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10637505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12356731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12792650, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12794087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12974390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15184391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15241487, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15616583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15664191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15788397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15952796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19879846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26942675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32721402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7588608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622688, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9480836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9596579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9649500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:16393692, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19565474, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21779493}.; FUNCTION: Acts as a transcriptional repressor.

The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24121476, PubMed:24318877, PubMed:26865365, PubMed:27474739). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:10722728, PubMed:11276205). Substrate recognition component in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective protein degradation process that mediates degradation of proteins with a -KFERQ motif: HSPA8/HSC70 specifically recognizes and binds cytosolic proteins bearing a -KFERQ motif and promotes their recruitment to the surface of the lysosome where they bind to lysosomal protein LAMP2 (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). KFERQ motif-containing proteins are eventually transported into the lysosomal lumen where they are degraded (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). In conjunction with LAMP2, facilitates MHC class II presentation of cytoplasmic antigens by guiding antigens to the lysosomal membrane for interaction with LAMP2 which then elicits MHC class II presentation of peptides to the cell membrane (PubMed:15894275). Participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway in conjunction with J domain-containing co-chaperones and the E3 ligase STUB1 (PubMed:23990462). It is recruited to clathrin-coated vesicles through its interaction with DNAJC6 leading to activation of HSPA8/HSC70 ATPase activity and therefore uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10722728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11276205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11559757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15894275, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21148293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21150129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23018488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24732912, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27474739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27916661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2799391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36586411, ECO:0000303|PubMed:24121476, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26865365}.",,,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP hydrolysis activity [GO:0016887]; ATP-dependent protein disaggregase activity [GO:0140545]; ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone [GO:0140662]; C3HC4-type RING finger domain binding [GO:0055131]; cadherin binding [GO:0045296]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; G protein-coupled receptor binding [GO:0001664]; heat shock protein binding [GO:0031072]; MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; protein carrier chaperone [GO:0140597]; protein folding chaperone [GO:0044183]; protein-folding chaperone binding [GO:0051087]; protein-macromolecule adaptor activity [GO:0030674]; receptor ligand activity [GO:0048018]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]; unfolded protein binding [GO:0051082],,CHEMBL1275223;

Critically involved, often in a cell type-dependent manner, in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (PubMed:10373550, PubMed:15358120, PubMed:20654631, PubMed:21212266). Its transcriptional activity is enhanced by CCND3 and slightly inhibited by CDK4 (PubMed:15358120). Important regulator of the cerebral cortex formation, functions in cerebral cortical neuroprogenitor cells to maintain proliferation and to block differentiation into neurons. Must be down-regulated in order for such cells to exit the cycle and differentiate (By similarity). Participates in the pathways by which SHH promotes cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells proliferation (By similarity). Critical for survival of mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSN), directs expression of OSN-specific genes (By similarity). May be involved in osteogenic differentiation (PubMed:22442021). Promotes cell proliferation and survival by inducing the expression of EGR1 sinergistically with ELK1. Once acetylated by EP300, binds to ARE sequences on target genes promoters, such as BCL2 and EGR1 (PubMed:21791614). Plays an anti-apoptotic role through the transcriptional regulation of BCL2, this function seems to be cell type-dependent (By similarity).

Involved in the formation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (tER). The transfer of membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus occurs via 50-70 nm transition vesicles which derive from part-rough, part-smooth transitional elements of the endoplasmic reticulum (tER). Vesicle budding from the tER is an ATP-dependent process. The ternary complex containing UFD1, VCP and NPLOC4 binds ubiquitinated proteins and is necessary for the export of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome. The NPLOC4-UFD1-VCP complex regulates spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis and is necessary for the formation of a closed nuclear envelope. Regulates E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of RNF19A. Component of the VCP/p97-AMFR/gp78 complex that participates in the final step of the sterol-mediated ubiquitination and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR. Mediates the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of CHRNA3 in cortical neurons as part of the STUB1-VCP-UBXN2A complex (PubMed:26265139). Involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908). Involved in clearance process by mediating G3BP1 extraction from stress granules (PubMed:29804830, PubMed:34739333). Also involved in DNA damage response: recruited to double-strand breaks (DSBs) sites in a RNF8- and RNF168-dependent manner and promotes the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites (PubMed:22020440, PubMed:22120668). Recruited to stalled replication forks by SPRTN: may act by mediating extraction of DNA polymerase eta (POLH) to prevent excessive translesion DNA synthesis and limit the incidence of mutations induced by DNA damage (PubMed:23042605, PubMed:23042607). Together with SPRTN metalloprotease, involved in the repair of covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) during DNA synthesis (PubMed:32152270). Involved in interstrand cross-link repair in response to replication stress by mediating unloading of the ubiquitinated CMG helicase complex (By similarity). Mediates extraction of PARP1 trapped to chromatin: recognizes and binds ubiquitinated PARP1 and promotes its removal (PubMed:35013556). Required for cytoplasmic retrotranslocation of stressed/damaged mitochondrial outer-membrane proteins and their subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:16186510, PubMed:21118995). Essential for the maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes and the clearance of ubiquitinated protein by autophagy (PubMed:20104022, PubMed:27753622). Acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon production by interacting with RIGI: interaction takes place when RIGI is ubiquitinated via 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on its CARD domains, leading to recruit RNF125 and promote ubiquitination and degradation of RIGI (PubMed:26471729). May play a role in the ubiquitin-dependent sorting of membrane proteins to lysosomes where they undergo degradation (PubMed:21822278). May more particularly play a role in caveolins sorting in cells (PubMed:21822278, PubMed:23335559).

UBOX5,P40692,DNA mismatch repair protein Mlh1 (MutL protein homolog 1),COCA2,"FUNCTION: Heterodimerizes with PMS2 to form MutL alpha, a component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. Lynch syndrome is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, it is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical Lynch syndrome is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected Lynch syndrome' or 'incomplete Lynch syndrome' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10323887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10413423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10598809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10627141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660333, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10671064, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10713887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882759, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11139242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427529, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11748856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11754112, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11781295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11793442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11839723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12095971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14961575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15139004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365996, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16083711, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17510385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20020535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21120944, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22753075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7757073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8566964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8571956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8574961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8797773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8993976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9067757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9218993, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9272156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9326924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9399661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9833759, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9927034, ECO:0000269|Ref.5}.
