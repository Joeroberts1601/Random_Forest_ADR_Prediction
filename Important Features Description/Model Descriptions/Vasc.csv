The MMS22L-TONSL complex is required to maintain genome integrity during DNA replication (PubMed:21055983, PubMed:21055984, PubMed:21055985). It mediates the assembly of RAD51 filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA): the MMS22L-TONSL complex is recruited to DSBs following histone replacement by histone chaperones and eviction of the replication protein A complex (RPA/RP-A) from DSBs (PubMed:21055983, PubMed:21055984, PubMed:21055985, PubMed:27797818, PubMed:29478807). Following recruitment to DSBs, the TONSL-MMS22L complex promotes recruitment of RAD51 filaments and subsequent homologous recombination (PubMed:27797818, PubMed:29478807). Within the complex, TONSL acts as a histone reader, which recognizes and binds newly synthesized histones following their replacement by histone chaperones (PubMed:27338793, PubMed:29478807).

Part of multimeric repressive chromatin complexes, where it is required for transmission and restoration of repressive histone marks, thereby preserving the epigenetic landscape (PubMed:28402439). Required for chromatin targeting and maximal enzymatic activity of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2); acts as a positive regulator of PRC2 activity by bridging the pre-existing histone H3K27me3 and newly recruited PRC2 on neighboring nucleosomes (PubMed:22009739). Acts as a corepressor for REST by facilitating histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT2 recruitment and H3K9 dimethylation at REST target genes for repression (PubMed:19061646). Involved in X chromosome inactivation in females: recruited to Xist RNA-coated X chromosome and facilitates propagation of H3K9me2 by anchoring EHMT2 (By similarity). Promotes EZH2 accumulation and H3K27me3 methylation at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby facilitating transcriptional repression at sites of DNA damage and homology-directed repair of DSBs (PubMed:29177481). Required for neuronal migration during brain development by repressing expression of RHOA (By similarity). By repressing the expression of SCN8A, contributes to the inhibition of intrinsic neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis (By similarity). In addition to acting as a chromatin reader, acts as a hydro-lyase (PubMed:28803779). Shows crotonyl-coA hydratase activity by mediating the conversion of crotonyl-CoA ((2E)-butenoyl-CoA) to beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA), thereby acting as a negative regulator of histone crotonylation (PubMed:28803779). Histone crotonylation is required during spermatogenesis; down-regulation of histone crotonylation by CDYL regulates the reactivation of sex chromosome-linked genes in round spermatids and histone replacement in elongating spermatids (By similarity).

Through its unique C-terminal domain (CTD, 52 heptapeptide tandem repeats) serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation and termination. CTD phosphorylation on Ser-5 mediates Pol II promoter escape, whereas phosphorylation on Ser-2 is required for Pol II pause release during transcription elongation and further pre-mRNA processing. Additionally, the regulation of gene expression levels depends on the balance between methylation and acetylation levels of the CTD-lysines. Initiation or early elongation steps of transcription of growth-factor-induced immediate early genes are regulated by the acetylation status of the CTD. Methylation and dimethylation have a repressive effect on target genes expression.

ADRA1B,P49407,Beta-arrestin-1 (Arrestin beta-1) (Non-visual arrestin-2),ARR1,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Involved in internalization of P2RY4 and UTP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 ands subsequent recycling. Involved in the degradation of cAMP by recruiting cAMP phosphodiesterases to ligand-activated receptors. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold is largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Recruits c-Src/SRC to ADRB2 resulting in ERK activation. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Is required for SP-stimulated endocytosis of NK1R and recruits c-Src/SRC to internalized NK1R resulting in ERK1/2 activation, which is required for the antiapoptotic effects of SP.

Binds phosphoinositides. Binds inositolhexakisphosphate (InsP6) (By similarity). Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced RAC1-LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation.

Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity. Is involved in dopamine-stimulated AKT1 activity in the striatum by disrupting the association of AKT1 with its negative regulator PP2A. Involved in AGTR1-mediated chemotaxis. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in endocytosis of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 and down-regulates TGF-beta signaling such as NF-kappa-B activation. Involved in endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein receptor/LDLR. Involved in endocytosis of smoothened homolog/Smo, which also requires GRK2. Involved in endocytosis of SLC9A5. Involved in endocytosis of ENG and subsequent TGF-beta-mediated ERK activation and migration of epithelial cells. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN (PubMed:26839314). Involved in insulin resistance by acting as insulin-induced signaling scaffold for SRC, AKT1 and INSR. Involved in regulation of inhibitory signaling of natural killer cells by recruiting PTPN6 and PTPN11 to KIR2DL1. Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Involved in the internalization of the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3. Acts as an adapter protein coupling FFAR4 receptor to specific downstream signaling pathways, as well as mediating receptor endocytosis (PubMed:22282525, PubMed:23809162). During the activation step of NLRP3 inflammasome, directly associates with NLRP3 leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inhibition of inflammation (PubMed:23809162). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10644702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12488444, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12582207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12949261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12958365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14711824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15054093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15125834, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15205453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15475570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618519, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15635042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15699339, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15878855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16144840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16280323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16378096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16492667, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16820410, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17540773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18419762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18604210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19325136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19620252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19643177, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20048153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22457824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23809162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24817116, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26839314}.",,,angiotensin receptor binding [GO:0031701]; D1 dopamine receptor binding [GO:0031748]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; G protein-coupled receptor binding [GO:0001664]; molecular adaptor activity [GO:0060090]; protein kinase B binding [GO:0043422]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625],,
