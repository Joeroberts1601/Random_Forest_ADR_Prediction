Required for normal development of the inner ear. Phosphorylates PLCG1, CBL and FRS2. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in response to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity). Phosphorylates phosphoglycerate kinase PGK1 under hypoxic conditions to promote its targeting to the mitochondrion and suppress the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate (PubMed:26942675). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10617468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10637505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12356731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12792650, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12794087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12974390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15184391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15241487, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15616583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15664191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15788397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15952796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794356, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19879846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26942675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32721402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7588608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622688, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9480836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9596579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9649500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:16393692, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19565474, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21779493}.; FUNCTION: Acts as a transcriptional repressor.

The antiviral activity can involve one or several isoform(s) and can be enhanced by the permanent PML-NB-associated protein DAXX or by the recruitment of p53/TP53 within these structures. Isoform PML-4 restricts varicella zoster virus (VZV) via sequestration of virion capsids in PML-NBs thereby preventing their nuclear egress and inhibiting formation of infectious virus particles. The sumoylated isoform PML-4 restricts rabies virus by inhibiting viral mRNA and protein synthesis. The cytoplasmic isoform PML-14 can restrict herpes simplex virus-1 (HHV-1) replication by sequestering the viral E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ICP0 in the cytoplasm. Isoform PML-6 shows restriction activity towards human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5) and influenza A virus strains PR8(H1N1) and ST364(H3N2). Sumoylated isoform PML-4 and isoform PML-12 show antiviral activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) by promoting nuclear sequestration of viral polymerase (P3D-POL) within PML NBs. Isoform PML-3 exhibits antiviral activity against poliovirus by inducing apoptosis in infected cells through the recruitment and the activation of p53/TP53 in the PML-NBs. Isoform PML-3 represses human foamy virus (HFV) transcription by complexing the HFV transactivator, bel1/tas, preventing its binding to viral DNA. PML may positively regulate infectious hepatitis C viral (HCV) production and isoform PML-2 may enhance adenovirus transcription.

Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis. MAP2K1/MEK1 has been shown to export PPARG from the nucleus. The MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC), as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14737111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29433126}.","ACT_SITE 190; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; JUN kinase kinase activity [GO:0008545]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; MAP-kinase scaffold activity [GO:0005078]; protein kinase activator activity [GO:0030295]; protein kinase activity [GO:0004672]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]; protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004712]; scaffold protein binding [GO:0097110],"DISEASE: Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 3 (CFC3) [MIM:615279]: A form of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects and intellectual disability.

Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex. The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable).

P2RY1,P32121,Beta-arrestin-2 (Arrestin beta-2) (Non-visual arrestin-3),ARB2 ARR2,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity. Is involved in dopamine-stimulated AKT1 activity in the striatum by disrupting the association of AKT1 with its negative regulator PP2A. Involved in AGTR1-mediated chemotaxis. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in endocytosis of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 and down-regulates TGF-beta signaling such as NF-kappa-B activation. Involved in endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein receptor/LDLR. Involved in endocytosis of smoothened homolog/Smo, which also requires GRK2. Involved in endocytosis of SLC9A5. Involved in endocytosis of ENG and subsequent TGF-beta-mediated ERK activation and migration of epithelial cells. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN (PubMed:26839314). Involved in insulin resistance by acting as insulin-induced signaling scaffold for SRC, AKT1 and INSR. Involved in regulation of inhibitory signaling of natural killer cells by recruiting PTPN6 and PTPN11 to KIR2DL1. Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Involved in the internalization of the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3.

In normal conditions, ubiquitinated and degraded in the cytoplasm by the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:11035812, PubMed:15601839, PubMed:29018201). In response to oxidative stress, electrophile metabolites inhibit activity of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting nuclear accumulation of NFE2L2/NRF2, heterodimerization with one of the small Maf proteins and binding to ARE elements of cytoprotective target genes (PubMed:19489739, PubMed:29590092). The NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway is also activated in response to selective autophagy: autophagy promotes interaction between KEAP1 and SQSTM1/p62 and subsequent inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and expression of cytoprotective genes (PubMed:20452972). The NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway is also activated during the unfolded protein response (UPR), contributing to redox homeostasis and cell survival following endoplasmic reticulum stress (By similarity). May also be involved in the transcriptional activation of genes of the beta-globin cluster by mediating enhancer activity of hypersensitive site 2 of the beta-globin locus control region (PubMed:7937919). Also plays an important role in the regulation of the innate immune response and antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing. It is a critical regulator of the innate immune response and survival during sepsis by maintaining redox homeostasis and restraint of the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways like MyD88-dependent and -independent and TNF-alpha signaling (By similarity). Suppresses macrophage inflammatory response by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and the induction of IL6 (By similarity). Binds to the proximity of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and inhibits RNA Pol II recruitment. The inhibition is independent of the NRF2-binding motif and reactive oxygen species level (By similarity). Represses antiviral cytosolic DNA sensing by suppressing the expression of the adapter protein STING1 and decreasing responsiveness to STING1 agonists while increasing susceptibility to infection with DNA viruses (PubMed:30158636). Once activated, limits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection and to virus-derived ligands through a mechanism that involves inhibition of IRF3 dimerization.

This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15244466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610016}.",,,,,CHEMBL2364701;

Key effector of the integrated stress response (ISR) to unfolded proteins: EIF2AK3/PERK specifically recognizes and binds misfolded proteins, leading to its activation and EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation (PubMed:10677345, PubMed:27917829, PubMed:31023583). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activators ATF4 and QRICH1, and hence allowing ATF4- and QRICH1-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:10026192, PubMed:10677345, PubMed:31023583, PubMed:33384352). The EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response increases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by promoting ATF4-mediated expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1, thereby increasing formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (PubMed:31023583). In contrast to most subcellular compartments, mitochondria are protected from the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response due to EIF2AK3/PERK inhibition by ATAD3A at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites (PubMed:39116259). In addition to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha, also phosphorylates NFE2L2/NRF2 in response to stress, promoting release of NFE2L2/NRF2 from the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to nuclear accumulation and activation of NFE2L2/NRF2 (By similarity).

Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating NF-kappa-B signaling and the target proteins for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity include: RIPK1, RIPK2, MAP3K2/MEKK2, DIABLO/SMAC, AIFM1, CCS, PTEN and BIRC5/survivin (PubMed:17560374, PubMed:17967870, PubMed:19473982, PubMed:20154138, PubMed:22103349, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Acts as an important regulator of innate immunity by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, thereby transforming RIPK2 into a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors, ultimately leading to activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (PubMed:19667203, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 also promotes recruitment of the LUBAC complex to RIPK2 (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636). Regulates the BMP signaling pathway and the SMAD and MAP3K7/TAK1 dependent pathways leading to NF-kappa-B and JNK activation (PubMed:17560374). Ubiquitination of CCS leads to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its physiologic target, SOD1, rather than proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20154138). Ubiquitination of MAP3K2/MEKK2 and AIFM1 does not lead to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17967870, PubMed:22103349). Plays a role in copper homeostasis by ubiquitinating COMMD1 and promoting its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:14685266). Can also function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation (PubMed:21145488). Ubiquitinates and therefore mediates the proteasomal degradation of BCL2 in response to apoptosis (PubMed:29020630). Protects cells from spontaneous formation of the ripoptosome, a large multi-protein complex that has the capability to kill cancer cells in a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manner (PubMed:22095281). Suppresses ripoptosome formation by ubiquitinating RIPK1 and CASP8 (PubMed:22095281). Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling and ubiquitinates TLE1, TLE2, TLE3, TLE4 and AES (PubMed:22304967). Ubiquitination of TLE3 results in inhibition of its interaction with TCF7L2/TCF4 thereby allowing efficient recruitment and binding of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin to TCF7L2/TCF4 that is required to initiate a Wnt-specific transcriptional program (PubMed:22304967). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12620238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14685266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16352606, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17967870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19473982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667203, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21145488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22103349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22304967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22607974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29020630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29452636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30026309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9230442, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22095281}.",,,cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity [GO:0004869]; cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity involved in apoptotic process [GO:0043027]; endopeptidase regulator activity [GO:0061135]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; protein serine/threonine kinase binding [GO:0120283]; ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]; ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842],"DISEASE: Lymphoproliferative syndrome, X-linked, 2 (XLP2) [MIM:300635]: A rare immunodeficiency characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Involved in the correct folding of proteins and degradation of misfolded proteins via its interaction with DNAJC10/ERdj5, probably to facilitate the release of DNAJC10/ERdj5 from its substrate (By similarity). Acts as a key repressor of the EIF2AK3/PERK and ERN1/IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) (PubMed:1550958, PubMed:11907036, PubMed:19538957). In the unstressed endoplasmic reticulum, recruited by DNAJB9/ERdj4 to the luminal region of ERN1/IRE1, leading to disrupt the dimerization of ERN1/IRE1, thereby inactivating ERN1/IRE1 (By similarity). Also binds and inactivates EIF2AK3/PERK in unstressed cells (PubMed:11907036). Accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum causes release of HSPA5/BiP from ERN1/IRE1 and EIF2AK3/PERK, allowing their homodimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:11907036). Plays an auxiliary role in post-translational transport of small presecretory proteins across endoplasmic reticulum (ER). May function as an allosteric modulator for SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex, likely cooperating with SEC62 to enable the productive insertion of these precursors into SEC61 channel. Appears to specifically regulate translocation of precursors having inhibitory residues in their mature region that weaken channel gating. May also play a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation (PubMed:26045166). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G3I8R9, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P20029, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11907036, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1550958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19538957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2294010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23769672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26045166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28332555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29719251}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Plays an important role in viral binding to the host cell membrane and entry for several flaviruses such as Dengue virus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (PubMed:15098107, PubMed:28053106, PubMed:33432092).

Acts as a downstream effector of the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 (PubMed:7744004). Activation by the binding of active CDC42 and RAC1 results in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues (PubMed:7744004). Full-length PAK2 stimulates cell survival and cell growth (PubMed:7744004). Phosphorylates MAPK4 and MAPK6 and activates the downstream target MAPKAPK5, a regulator of F-actin polymerization and cell migration (PubMed:21317288). Phosphorylates JUN and plays an important role in EGF-induced cell proliferation (PubMed:21177766). Phosphorylates many other substrates including histone H4 to promote assembly of H3.3 and H4 into nucleosomes, BAD, ribosomal protein S6, or MBP (PubMed:21724829). Phosphorylates CASP7, thereby preventing its activity (PubMed:21555521, PubMed:27889207). Additionally, associates with ARHGEF7 and GIT1 to perform kinase-independent functions such as spindle orientation control during mitosis (PubMed:19273597, PubMed:19923322). On the other hand, apoptotic stimuli such as DNA damage lead to caspase-mediated cleavage of PAK2, generating PAK-2p34, an active p34 fragment that translocates to the nucleus and promotes cellular apoptosis involving the JNK signaling pathway (PubMed:12853446, PubMed:16617111, PubMed:9171063).

Ubiquitination is mediated by a non-canonical E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme UBA6 (PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitinates CASP3, CASP7 and CASP9 and inhibits their caspase activity; also ubiquitinates their procaspases but to a weaker extent (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitinates pro-apoptotic factors DIABLO/SMAC and HTRA2 (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106). DIABLO/SMAC antagonizes the caspase inhibition activity of BIRC6 by competing for the same binding sites as the caspases (PubMed:18329369, PubMed:36758106). Ubiquitinates the autophagy protein MAP1LC3B; this activity is also inhibited by DIABLO/SMAC (PubMed:36758105). Important regulator for the final stages of cytokinesis (PubMed:18329369).

Mediates glutamate, aspartate, serine, histidine or tyrosine ADP-ribosylation of proteins: the ADP-D-ribosyl group of NAD(+) is transferred to the acceptor carboxyl group of target residues and further ADP-ribosyl groups are transferred to the 2'-position of the terminal adenosine moiety, building up a polymer with an average chain length of 20-30 units (PubMed:19764761, PubMed:25043379, PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:35393539, PubMed:7852410, PubMed:9315851). Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:33186521, PubMed:34874266). Specificity for the different amino acids is conferred by interacting factors, such as HPF1 and NMNAT1 (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33186521, PubMed:33589610, PubMed:34625544, PubMed:34874266). Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 confers serine specificity by completing the PARP1 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:29954836, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33186521, PubMed:33589610, PubMed:34625544, PubMed:34874266).

Following interaction with NMNAT1, catalyzes glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; NMNAT1 confers glutamate and aspartate specificity (By similarity). PARP1 initiates the repair of DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones (H2BS6ADPr and H3S10ADPr), thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:17177976, PubMed:18172500, PubMed:19344625, PubMed:19661379, PubMed:23230272, PubMed:27067600, PubMed:34465625, PubMed:34874266).

Acts as a repressor of transcription: binds to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure in a manner similar to histone H1, thereby altering RNA polymerase II (PubMed:15607977, PubMed:22464733). Acts both as a positive and negative regulator of transcription elongation, depending on the context (PubMed:27256882, PubMed:35393539).

In T-cells, functions primarily as a coreceptor for MHC class II molecule:peptide complex. The antigens presented by class II peptides are derived from extracellular proteins while class I peptides are derived from cytosolic proteins. Interacts simultaneously with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the MHC class II presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). In turn, recruits the Src kinase LCK to the vicinity of the TCR-CD3 complex. LCK then initiates different intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating various substrates ultimately leading to lymphokine production, motility, adhesion and activation of T-helper cells. In other cells such as macrophages or NK cells, plays a role in differentiation/activation, cytokine expression and cell migration in a TCR/LCK-independent pathway.

In complex with the beta chain HLA-DRB, displays antigenic peptides on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-DR-restricted CD4-positive T cells. This guides antigen-specific T-helper effector functions, both antibody-mediated immune response and macrophage activation, to ultimately eliminate the infectious agents and transformed cells (PubMed:15265931, PubMed:15322540, PubMed:17334368, PubMed:22327072, PubMed:24190431, PubMed:27591323, PubMed:29884618, PubMed:31495665, PubMed:8145819, PubMed:9075930).

CD4,P04234,T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 delta chain (T-cell receptor T3 delta chain) (CD antigen CD3d),T3D,"FUNCTION: Part of the TCR-CD3 complex present on T-lymphocyte cell surface that plays an essential role in adaptive immune response. When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:2470098). In addition of this role of signal transduction in T-cell activation, CD3D plays an essential role in thymocyte differentiation. Indeed, participates in correct intracellular TCR-CD3 complex assembly and surface expression. In absence of a functional TCR-CD3 complex, thymocytes are unable to differentiate properly. Interacts with CD4 and CD8 and thus serves to establish a functional link between the TCR and coreceptors CD4 and CD8, which is needed for activation and positive selection of CD4 or CD8 T-cells (PubMed:12215456). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12215456, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12507424, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2470098}.",,,identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; transmembrane signaling receptor activity [GO:0004888],"DISEASE: Immunodeficiency 19, severe combined (IMD19) [MIM:615617]: An autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by onset in early infancy of recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497}.",,,clathrin binding [GO:0030276]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048],,

Exerts distinct biological functions in the mammary epithelial cells and T cells in a tissue-specific manner. Necessary and sufficient for commitment of CD4 lineage, while its absence causes CD8 commitment. Development of immature T-cell precursors (thymocytes) to either the CD4 helper or CD8 killer T-cell lineages correlates precisely with their T-cell receptor specificity for major histocompatibility complex class II or class I molecules, respectively. Cross-antagonism between ZBTB7B and CBF complexes are determinative to CD4 versus CD8 cell fate decision. Suppresses RUNX3 expression and imposes CD4+ lineage fate by inducing the SOCS suppressors of cytokine signaling. induces, as a transcriptional activator, SOCS genes expression which represses RUNX3 expression and promotes the CD4+ lineage fate. During CD4 lineage commitment, associates with multiple sites at the CD8 locus, acting as a negative regulator of the CD8 promoter and enhancers by epigenetic silencing through the recruitment of class II histone deacetylases, such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, to these loci. Regulates the development of IL17-producing CD1d-restricted naural killer (NK) T cells. Also functions as an important metabolic regulator in the lactating mammary glands. Critical feed-forward regulator of insulin signaling in mammary gland lactation, directly regulates expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and insulin-induced Akt-mTOR-SREBP signaling (By similarity). Transcriptional repressor of the collagen COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. May also function as a repressor of fibronectin and possibly other extracellular matrix genes (PubMed:9370309).

IL-27 has pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, that can regulate T-helper cell development, suppress T-cell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic T-cell activity, induce isotype switching in B-cells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 T-helper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper T-cells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma/IFN-gamma production of naive CD4 T-cells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL-27-mediated signal transduction. IL-27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21- and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERK-dependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/T-Bet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 up-regulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 T-cells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL-27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL-17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. While IL-27 suppressed the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of anti-inflammatory inducible regulatory T-cells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL-27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL-27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on T-cells. Another important role of IL-27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II.

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:7947975). Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (Probable).

In an alternative pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis, converts 2-arachidonoyl lysophopholipids to prostanoid lysophopholipids, which are then hydrolyzed by intracellular phospholipases to release free prostanoids (PubMed:27642067). Metabolizes 2-arachidonoyl glycerol yielding the glyceryl ester of PGH2, a process that can contribute to pain response (PubMed:22942274). Generates lipid mediators from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via a lipoxygenase-type mechanism. Oxygenates PUFAs to hydroperoxy compounds and then reduces them to corresponding alcohols (PubMed:11034610, PubMed:11192938, PubMed:9048568, PubMed:9261177). Plays a role in the generation of resolution phase interaction products (resolvins) during both sterile and infectious inflammation (PubMed:12391014). Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs) (PubMed:12391014). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2 (PubMed:21206090). In vascular endothelial cells, converts docosapentaenoate (DPA, C22:5(n-3)) to 13R-HDPA, a precursor for 13-series resolvins (RvTs) shown to activate macrophage phagocytosis during bacterial infection (PubMed:26236990). In activated leukocytes, contributes to oxygenation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoates (HETE) to diHETES (5,15-diHETE and 5,11-diHETE) (PubMed:22068350, PubMed:26282205).
