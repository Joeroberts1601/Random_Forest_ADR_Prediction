MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10393181, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10617468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12356731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12974390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15788397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15952796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34497368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35216969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8325880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9155018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9480836}.","ACT_SITE 166; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10027""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0140297]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; JUN kinase activity [GO:0004705]; MAP kinase activity [GO:0004707]; phosphatase binding [GO:0019902]; phosphotyrosine residue binding [GO:0001784]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674],,CHEMBL3385;

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated.

The same mechanism seems to be used by other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enhance their replication (PubMed:35922005). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18155731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35922005}.","ACT_SITE 121; /evidence=""ECO:0000269|PubMed:30420425""; ACT_SITE 163; /evidence=""ECO:0000269|PubMed:16123779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19133298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19694615, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20890311, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28864531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30420425""",,cysteine-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004197]; cysteine-type peptidase activity [GO:0008234]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802],,CHEMBL3308;
GLYR1,Q9UMX0,Ubiquilin-1 (Protein linking IAP with cytoskeleton 1) (PLIC-1) (hPLIC-1),DA41 PLIC1,"FUNCTION: Plays an important role in the regulation of different protein degradation mechanisms and pathways including ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. Mediates the proteasomal targeting of misfolded or accumulated proteins for degradation by binding (via UBA domain) to their polyubiquitin chains and by interacting (via ubiquitin-like domain) with the subunits of the proteasome (PubMed:15147878). Plays a role in the ERAD pathway via its interaction with ER-localized proteins UBXN4, VCP and HERPUD1 and may form a link between the polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates and the proteasome (PubMed:18307982, PubMed:19822669). Involved in the regulation of macroautophagy and autophagosome formation; required for maturation of autophagy-related protein LC3 from the cytosolic form LC3-I to the membrane-bound form LC3-II and may assist in the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes by mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (PubMed:19148225, PubMed:20529957, PubMed:23459205). Negatively regulates the TICAM1/TRIF-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway by decreasing the abundance of TICAM1 via the autophagic pathway (PubMed:21695056). Promotes the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of ORAI1, consequently down-regulating the ORAI1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization (PubMed:23307288). Suppresses the maturation and proteasomal degradation of amyloid beta A4 protein (A4) by stimulating the lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination. Delays the maturation of A4 by sequestering it in the Golgi apparatus and preventing its transport to the cell surface for subsequent processing (By similarity). Ubiquitinates BCL2L10 and thereby stabilizes protein abundance (PubMed:22233804). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JJP9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18307982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19148225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19822669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20529957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21695056, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22233804, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23307288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23459205, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15147878}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Plays a role in unfolded protein response (UPR) by attenuating the induction of UPR-inducible genes, DDTI3/CHOP, HSPA5 and PDIA2 during ER stress (PubMed:18953672).

Plays an essential role in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Regulates both osteogenesis and postnatal bone mineralization by osteoblasts. Promotes apoptosis in chondrocytes, but can also promote cancer cell proliferation. Required for normal development of the inner ear. Phosphorylates PLCG1, CBL and FRS2. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Plays a role in the regulation of vitamin D metabolism. Mutations that lead to constitutive kinase activation or impair normal FGFR3 maturation, internalization and degradation lead to aberrant signaling. Over-expressed or constitutively activated FGFR3 promotes activation of PTPN11/SHP2, STAT1, STAT5A and STAT5B. Secreted isoform 3 retains its capacity to bind FGF1 and FGF2 and hence may interfere with FGF signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10611230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11294897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11703096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16410555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16597617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17145761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17311277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17509076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17561467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19088846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19286672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663044}.","ACT_SITE 617; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10028""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; boss receptor activity [GO:0008288]; brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor activity [GO:0060175]; epidermal growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005006]; fibroblast growth factor binding [GO:0017134]; fibroblast growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005007]; GPI-linked ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005004]; hepatocyte growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005008]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; insulin receptor activity [GO:0005009]; insulin-like growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005010]; macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor activity [GO:0005011]; placental growth factor receptor activity [GO:0036332]; platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor activity [GO:0005018]; platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor activity [GO:0005019]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; protein tyrosine kinase collagen receptor activity [GO:0038062]; stem cell factor receptor activity [GO:0005020]; transmembrane-ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005005]; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005021],"DISEASE: Achondroplasia (ACH) [MIM:100800]: A frequent form of short-limb dwarfism.

Heterodimers function as amino acids exchangers, the specificity of the substrate depending on the SLC7A subunit. Heterodimers SLC3A2/SLC7A6 or SLC3A2/SLC7A7 mediate the uptake of dibasic amino acids (PubMed:10903140, PubMed:9829974). Heterodimer SLC3A2/SLC7A11 functions as an antiporter by mediating the exchange of extracellular anionic L-cystine and intracellular L-glutamate across the cellular plasma membrane (PubMed:34880232). SLC3A2/SLC7A10 translocates small neutral L- and D-amino acids across the plasma membrane (By similarity). SLC3A2/SLC75 or SLC3A2/SLC7A8 translocates neutral amino acids with broad specificity, thyroid hormones and L-DOPA (PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11389679, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:11742812, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:12716892, PubMed:15980244, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:33298890, PubMed:33758168).

When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:1384049, PubMed:1385158, PubMed:2470098, PubMed:7509083). CD3Z ITAMs phosphorylation creates multiple docking sites for the protein kinase ZAP70 leading to ZAP70 phosphorylation and its conversion into a catalytically active enzyme (PubMed:7509083).

ICAM1,Q8NEV9,Interleukin-27 subunit alpha (IL-27 subunit alpha) (IL-27-A) (IL27-A) (Interleukin-30) (p28),IL27A IL30,"FUNCTION: Associates with EBI3 to form the IL-27 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity. IL-27 has pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, that can regulate T-helper cell development, suppress T-cell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic T-cell activity, induce isotype switching in B-cells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 T-helper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper T-cells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma/IFN-gamma production of naive CD4 T-cells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL-27-mediated signal transduction. IL-27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21- and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERK-dependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/T-Bet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 up-regulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 T-cells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL-27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL-17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. While IL-27 suppressed the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of anti-inflammatory inducible regulatory T-cells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL-27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL-27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on T-cells. Another important role of IL-27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II. IL-27 also demonstrates antiviral activity with inhibitory properties on HIV-1 replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121660, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14565860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17068156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18191724}.",,,cytokine activity [GO:0005125]; interleukin-27 receptor binding [GO:0045523]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102],,

ADRB2,P32121,Beta-arrestin-2 (Arrestin beta-2) (Non-visual arrestin-3),ARB2 ARR2,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity. Is involved in dopamine-stimulated AKT1 activity in the striatum by disrupting the association of AKT1 with its negative regulator PP2A. Involved in AGTR1-mediated chemotaxis. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs.

Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Also hydroxylates HIF2A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Has a preference for the CODD site for both HIF1A and HIF2A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Hydroxylation on the NODD site by EGLN3 appears to require prior hydroxylation on the CODD site (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). ELGN3 is the most important isozyme in limiting physiological activation of HIFs (particularly HIF2A) in hypoxia.

Plays a central role in ADRB2 recycling and resensitization after prolonged agonist stimulation by constitutively binding ADRB2, mediating deubiquitination of ADRB2 and inhibiting lysosomal trafficking of ADRB2. Upon dissociation, it is probably transferred to the translocated beta-arrestins, possibly leading to beta-arrestins deubiquitination and disengagement from ADRB2 (PubMed:19424180).

ADRB2,P12931,Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (EC 2.7.10.2) (Proto-oncogene c-Src) (pp60c-src) (p60-Src),SRC1,"FUNCTION: Non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase which is activated following engagement of many different classes of cellular receptors including immune response receptors, integrins and other adhesion receptors, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors as well as cytokine receptors (PubMed:34234773). Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) (Probable). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN) (PubMed:21411625). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1 (Probable). Phosphorylates PKP3 at 'Tyr-195' in response to reactive oxygen species, which may cause the release of PKP3 from desmosome cell junctions into the cytoplasm (PubMed:25501895). Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors (By similarity).

Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor (Probable). Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus (PubMed:7853507). Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function (PubMed:14585963, PubMed:8755529). Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (PubMed:12615910).

ADRB2,P49407,Beta-arrestin-1 (Arrestin beta-1) (Non-visual arrestin-2),ARR1,"FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Involved in internalization of P2RY4 and UTP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 ands subsequent recycling. Involved in the degradation of cAMP by recruiting cAMP phosphodiesterases to ligand-activated receptors. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold is largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Recruits c-Src/SRC to ADRB2 resulting in ERK activation. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Is required for SP-stimulated endocytosis of NK1R and recruits c-Src/SRC to internalized NK1R resulting in ERK1/2 activation, which is required for the antiapoptotic effects of SP. Is involved in proteinase-activated F2RL1-mediated ERK activity. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. Is involved in alpha-thrombin-stimulated AKT1 signaling. Is involved in IGF1-stimulated AKT1 signaling leading to increased protection from apoptosis. Involved in activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and in actin bundle formation. Involved in F2RL1-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis. Involved in AGTR1-mediated stress fiber formation by acting together with GNAQ to activate RHOA. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Involved in OPRD1-stimulated transcriptional regulation by translocating to CDKN1B and FOS promoter regions and recruiting EP300 resulting in acetylation of histone H4. Involved in regulation of LEF1 transcriptional activity via interaction with DVL1 and/or DVL2 Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN. Binds phosphoinositides. Binds inositolhexakisphosphate (InsP6) (By similarity). Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced RAC1-LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. Involved in the internalization of the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3. Negatively regulates the NOTCH signaling pathway by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH1 by ITCH.
