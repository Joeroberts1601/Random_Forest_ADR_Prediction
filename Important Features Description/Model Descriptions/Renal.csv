CYP51A1,O43866,CD5 antigen-like (Apoptosis inhibitor expressed by macrophages) (hAIM) (CT-2) (IgM-associated peptide) (SP-alpha),API6,"FUNCTION: Secreted protein that acts as a key regulator of lipid synthesis: mainly expressed by macrophages in lymphoid and inflamed tissues and regulates mechanisms in inflammatory responses, such as infection or atherosclerosis. Able to inhibit lipid droplet size in adipocytes. Following incorporation into mature adipocytes via CD36-mediated endocytosis, associates with cytosolic FASN, inhibiting fatty acid synthase activity and leading to lipolysis, the degradation of triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). CD5L-induced lipolysis occurs with progression of obesity: participates in obesity-associated inflammation following recruitment of inflammatory macrophages into adipose tissues, a cause of insulin resistance and obesity-related metabolic disease. Regulation of intracellular lipids mediated by CD5L has a direct effect on transcription regulation mediated by nuclear receptors ROR-gamma (RORC). Acts as a key regulator of metabolic switch in T-helper Th17 cells. Regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Th17 cells by altering the lipid content and limiting synthesis of cholesterol ligand of RORC, the master transcription factor of Th17-cell differentiation. CD5L is mainly present in non-pathogenic Th17 cells, where it decreases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acyls (PUFA), affecting two metabolic proteins MSMO1 and CYP51A1, which synthesize ligands of RORC, limiting RORC activity and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Participates in obesity-associated autoimmunity via its association with IgM, interfering with the binding of IgM to Fcalpha/mu receptor and enhancing the development of long-lived plasma cells that produce high-affinity IgG autoantibodies (By similarity). Also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in macrophages: promotes macrophage survival from the apoptotic effects of oxidized lipids in case of atherosclerosis (PubMed:24295828). Involved in early response to microbial infection against various pathogens by acting as a pattern recognition receptor and by promoting autophagy (PubMed:16030018, PubMed:24223991, PubMed:24583716, PubMed:25713983). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QWK4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16030018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24223991, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24295828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24583716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25713983}.",,,serine-type endopeptidase activity [GO:0004252],,

Acts as a receptor for several ligands including prosaposin, osteocalcin or neuroprotectin D1. Ligand binding induces endocytosis, followed by an ERK phosphorylation cascade (PubMed:11439185, PubMed:23690594). Acts as a receptor for osteocalcin (OCN) to regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and central nervous system myelination. Mechanistically, plays a negative role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during development via activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, regulates the stability of myelin or resistance of myelin itself to demyelination.

Functions as part of a cytosolic protein quality control complex, the BAG6/BAT3 complex, which maintains these client proteins in a soluble state and participates in their proper delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum or alternatively can promote their sorting to the proteasome where they undergo degradation (PubMed:20516149, PubMed:21636303, PubMed:21743475, PubMed:28104892). The BAG6/BAT3 complex is involved in the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored/type II transmembrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Recruited to ribosomes, it interacts with the transmembrane region of newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins and together with SGTA and ASNA1 mediates their delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20516149, PubMed:20676083, PubMed:25535373, PubMed:28104892). Client proteins that cannot be properly delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum are ubiquitinated by RNF126, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase associated with BAG6 and are sorted to the proteasome (PubMed:24981174, PubMed:27193484, PubMed:28104892). SGTA which prevents the recruitment of RNF126 to BAG6 may negatively regulate the ubiquitination and the proteasomal degradation of client proteins (PubMed:23129660, PubMed:25179605, PubMed:27193484). Similarly, the BAG6/BAT3 complex also functions as a sorting platform for proteins of the secretory pathway that are mislocalized to the cytosol either delivering them to the proteasome for degradation or to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:21743475). The BAG6/BAT3 complex also plays a role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), a quality control mechanism that eliminates unwanted proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum through their retrotranslocation to the cytosol and their targeting to the proteasome. It maintains these retrotranslocated proteins in an unfolded yet soluble state condition in the cytosol to ensure their proper delivery to the proteasome (PubMed:21636303). BAG6 is also required for selective ubiquitin-mediated degradation of defective nascent chain polypeptides by the proteasome. In this context, it may participate in the production of antigenic peptides and play a role in antigen presentation in immune response (By similarity). BAG6 is also involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. BAG6 may ensure the proper degradation of these proteins and thereby protects the endoplasmic reticulum from protein overload upon stress (PubMed:26565908). By inhibiting the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of HSPA2 it may also play a role in the assembly of the synaptonemal complex during spermatogenesis (By similarity). Also positively regulates apoptosis by interacting with and stabilizing the proapoptotic factor AIFM1 (By similarity). By controlling the steady-state expression of the IGF1R receptor, indirectly regulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway (PubMed:26692333). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z1R2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20516149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20676083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21636303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21743475, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23129660, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24981174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25179605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26565908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26692333, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27193484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28104892}.; FUNCTION: Involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis: following DNA damage, accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with p300/EP300, enhancing p300/EP300-mediated p53/TP53 acetylation leading to increase p53/TP53 transcriptional activity (PubMed:17403783).

Gasdermin pores also allow the release of mature caspase-7 (CASP7) (By similarity).

Cleaves the ester bond between the C-terminus of the HC and GalNAc residue of the chondroitin sulfate chain in I-alpha-I complex followed by transesterification of the HC to hyaluronan. In the process, potentiates the antiprotease function of I-alpha-I complex through release of free bikunin (PubMed:15917224, PubMed:16873769, PubMed:20463016). Acts as a catalyst in the formation of hyaluronan-HC oligomers and hyaluronan-rich matrix surrounding the cumulus cell-oocyte complex, a necessary step for oocyte fertilization (PubMed:26468290). Assembles hyaluronan in pericellular matrices that serve as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Enables binding of hyaluronan deposited on the surface of macrophages to LYVE1 on lymphatic endothelium and facilitates macrophage extravasation. Alters hyaluronan binding to functionally latent CD44 on vascular endothelium, switching CD44 into an active state that supports leukocyte rolling (PubMed:15060082, PubMed:26823460). Modulates the interaction of chemokines with extracellular matrix components and proteoglycans on endothelial cell surface, likely preventing chemokine gradient formation (PubMed:27044744). In a negative feedback mechanism, may limit excessive neutrophil recruitment at inflammatory sites by antagonizing the association of CXCL8 with glycosaminoglycans on vascular endothelium (PubMed:24501198). Has a role in osteogenesis and bone remodeling. Inhibits BMP2-dependent differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblasts (PubMed:16771708, PubMed:18586671).

Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Has a promiscuous chemokine-binding profile, interacting with inflammatory chemokines of both the CXC and the CC subfamilies but not with homeostatic chemokines. Acts as a receptor for chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL14, CCL17, CXCL5, CXCL6, IL8/CXCL8, CXCL11, GRO, RANTES, MCP-1, TARC and also for the malaria parasites P.vivax and P.knowlesi. May regulate chemokine bioavailability and, consequently, leukocyte recruitment through two distinct mechanisms: when expressed in endothelial cells, it sustains the abluminal to luminal transcytosis of tissue-derived chemokines and their subsequent presentation to circulating leukocytes; when expressed in erythrocytes, serves as blood reservoir of cognate chemokines but also as a chemokine sink, buffering potential surges in plasma chemokine levels.",,,C-C chemokine binding [GO:0019957]; G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; signaling receptor activity [GO:0038023]; transmembrane signaling receptor activity [GO:0004888],,CHEMBL2321626;

The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883).
