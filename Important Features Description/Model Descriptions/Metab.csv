Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, regulates formation of membrane ruffles, cell adhesion and cell migration, and promotes cancer cell invasion. Activates several signaling pathways in response to ligand binding, including the ERK1/2 and the JNK pathway (PubMed:20504948, PubMed:30982609). Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG2, GRB2, SLA2 and CBL. Activation of PLCG2 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, that then lead to the activation of protein kinase C family members, especially PRKCD. Phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leads to activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Activated CSF1R also mediates activation of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, and of the SRC family kinases SRC, FYN and YES1. Activated CSF1R transmits signals both via proteins that directly interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain, or via adapter proteins, such as GRB2. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT3, STAT5A and/or STAT5B. Promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC1 and INPP5D/SHIP-1. Receptor signaling is down-regulated by protein phosphatases, such as INPP5D/SHIP-1, that dephosphorylate the receptor and its downstream effectors, and by rapid internalization of the activated receptor. In the central nervous system, may play a role in the development of microglia macrophages (PubMed:30982608). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12882960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15117969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16170366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16648572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17121910, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18467591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18814279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19193011, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934330, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20489731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20829061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30982608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30982609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7683918}.","ACT_SITE 778; /note=""Proton acceptor""; /evidence=""ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00159, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU10028""",,ATP binding [GO:0005524]; boss receptor activity [GO:0008288]; brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor activity [GO:0060175]; cytokine binding [GO:0019955]; epidermal growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005006]; fibroblast growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005007]; GPI-linked ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005004]; growth factor binding [GO:0019838]; hepatocyte growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005008]; histone H2AXY142 kinase activity [GO:0140801]; histone H3Y41 kinase activity [GO:0035401]; insulin receptor activity [GO:0005009]; insulin-like growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005010]; macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor activity [GO:0005011]; placental growth factor receptor activity [GO:0036332]; platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor activity [GO:0005018]; platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor activity [GO:0005019]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; protein phosphatase binding [GO:0019903]; protein tyrosine kinase activity [GO:0004713]; protein tyrosine kinase collagen receptor activity [GO:0038062]; stem cell factor receptor activity [GO:0005020]; transmembrane-ephrin receptor activity [GO:0005005]; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity [GO:0005021],"DISEASE: Note=Aberrant expression of CSF1 or CSF1R can promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion and formation of metastases.

Transporter activity is driven by a transmembrane Na(+) electrochemical gradient set by the Na(+)/K(+) pump (PubMed:20980548, PubMed:34880492, PubMed:35077764, PubMed:8563765, PubMed:37217492). Has a primary role in the transport of dietary monosaccharides from enterocytes to blood. Responsible for the absorption of D-glucose or D-galactose across the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes, whereas basolateral exit is provided by GLUT2. Additionally, functions as a D-glucose sensor in enteroendocrine cells, triggering the secretion of the incretins GCG and GIP that control food intake and energy homeostasis (By similarity) (PubMed:8563765). Together with SGLT2, functions in reabsorption of D-glucose from glomerular filtrate, playing a nonredundant role in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules (By similarity). Transports D-glucose into endometrial epithelial cells, controlling glycogen synthesis and nutritional support for the embryo as well as the decidual transformation of endometrium prior to conception (PubMed:28974690). Acts as a water channel enabling passive water transport across the plasma membrane in response to the osmotic gradient created upon sugar and Na(+) uptake. Has high water conductivity, comparable to aquaporins, and therefore is expected to play an important role in transepithelial water permeability, especially in the small intestine. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8C3K6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14695256, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20980548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26945065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28974690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34880492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35077764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37217492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8563765}.",,,alpha-glucoside transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015151]; D-glucose transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0055056]; D-glucose:sodium symporter activity [GO:0005412]; fucose transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015150]; galactose transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0005354]; galactose:sodium symporter activity [GO:0015371]; myo-inositol:sodium symporter activity [GO:0005367]; pentose transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0015146]; water transmembrane transporter activity [GO:0005372],"DISEASE: Congenital glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) [MIM:606824]: Intestinal monosaccharide transporter deficiency.

Signals via G-protein and beta-arrestin pathways (PubMed:22282525, PubMed:22343897, PubMed:24742677, PubMed:24817122, PubMed:27852822). LCFAs sensing initiates activation of phosphoinositidase C-linked G proteins GNAQ and GNA11 (G(q)/G(11)), inducing a variety of cellular responses via second messenger pathways such as intracellular calcium mobilization, modulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (PubMed:22282525, PubMed:22343897, PubMed:24742677, PubMed:27852822). After LCFAs binding, associates with beta-arrestin ARRB2 that acts as an adapter protein coupling the receptor to specific downstream signaling pathways, as well as mediating receptor endocytosis (PubMed:22282525, PubMed:24817122). In response to dietary fats, plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (By similarity). Acts as a receptor for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at primary cilium of perivascular preadipocytes, initiating an adipogenic program via cAMP and CTCF-dependent chromatin remodeling that ultimately results in transcriptional activation of adipogenic genes and cell cycle entry (By similarity). Induces differentiation of brown adipocytes probably via autocrine and endocrine functions of FGF21 hormone (By similarity). Activates brown adipocytes by initiating intracellular calcium signaling that leads to mitochondrial depolarization and fission, and overall increased mitochondrial respiration (By similarity). Consequently stimulates fatty acid uptake and oxidation in mitochondria together with UCP1-mediated thermogenic respiration, eventually reducing fat mass (By similarity). Regulates bi-potential differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoblasts or adipocytes likely by up-regulating distinct integrins (By similarity). In response to dietary fats regulates hormone secretion and appetite (By similarity). Stimulates GIP and GLP1 secretion from enteroendocrine cells as well as GCG secretion in pancreatic alpha cells, thereby playing a role in the regulation of blood glucose levels (By similarity). Negatively regulates glucose-induced SST secretion in pancreatic delta cells (By similarity). Mediates LCFAs inhibition of GHRL secretion, an appetite-controlling hormone (By similarity). In taste buds, contributes to sensing of dietary fatty acids by the gustatory system (By similarity). During the inflammatory response, promotes anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage differentiation in adipose tissue (By similarity). Mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (PubMed:23809162). In this pathway, interacts with adapter protein ARRB2 and inhibits the priming step triggered by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) at the level of TAK1 and TAB1 (By similarity). Further inhibits the activation step when ARRB2 directly associates with NLRP3, leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release (PubMed:23809162). Mediates LCFAs anti-apoptotic effects (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q7TMA4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22282525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22343897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23809162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24742677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24817122, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27852822}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Receptor for LCFAs decoupled from G-protein signaling.
